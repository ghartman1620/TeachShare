Some examples of sensory-motor activities include:

- Constructing letters out of Playdoh or other material to match written or printed models. 

- Tracing them on a rough textured surface such as sandpaper cut in the shape of the letter or number (with fingertip or chalk).
 
- Taping out and walking on large letters or numbers on the floor gives a whole body sense of the shapes.

- “Air Guitar Letters,” or standing at a distance from a large model of a letter or number on the board, and tracing it using the whole arm with pointed finger so that sensation receptors in the shoulder joint develop a “memory” of the shape that can help the fingers also learn it.

Engaging in this specialized practice can be beneficial to all young students as they build early literacy skills, and especially helpful to those that need extra support in learning to form letters.

Tilting up the writing surface (e.g. with an easel or slant board) also tilts the wrist upward, which supports opposing the thumb to fingers and the ability of the fingers to move more freely. Offering young students very small pieces of crayon or chalk forces them to use thumb and pads or tips of fingers to hold on, rather than using the palm or pressing the crayon tightly with the thumb toward the knuckles and index finger, which makes it more difficulty to manipulate it with finger movements.",UDL II 4.1 Provide Multiple Means of Action and Expression: Vary the methods for response and navigation,"Avoid power struggles with students around trying to get them to change their grasp on pencils while in the act of drawing or forming letters, especially at these young ages. It is typically more effective to provide many opportunities that build hand strength and dexterity outside of using drawing utensils or modifying the conditions when they are (e.g. raised surfaces, different types of pencils or crayons). While a dynamic tripod grasp is the most efficient for most people, there are other functional grasp patterns, such as a quadrapod (thumb and three fingers) or positioning the shaft pencil in between the index and middle fingers while using a tripod of fingertips. Students who do not have a lot of hand strength may do better with one of these grasp patterns, and will just become frustrated with drawing and writing if frequently asked to make a change. Do take note, though, of students who are using inefficient grasps, such as in the palm, tightly squeezed thumb wrap, or using the ends of all fingertips.

Teachers can also incorporate tactile sensation by providing physical props related to the lesson that students can explore or hold while engaging in instruction.

One way teachers can do this is by breaking up sitting time. For example, students can move to different stations for different parts of the assignment, stand when taking turns reading text, or act out a written text. Teachers can also incorporate tactile sensation by providing physical props related to the lesson that students can explore or hold while engaging in instruction. The more the activity provides opportunities for “sensory input,” the more students with this type of difficulty will be engaged with the information being presented, and the less they will feel driven to seek it out in other ways.","UDL I 3.3 Provide Multiple Means of Representation: Guide information processing, visualization, and manipulation","Help students that are easily distracted due to sensory seeking increase their self-awareness of how often they are getting out of their seat. Discuss how frequently leaving the seat impacts productivity and what strategies are helpful to improve task persistence. This can take many forms, such as keeping an index card taped to the desktop where the teacher and/or the student can keep tally marks for given time periods. Teachers and students can tally how often the student has gotten out of his or her seat, whether or not he or she completed an assignment, and what (if any) strategies helped get him or her back on task.",UDL II 6.4 Provide Multiple Means of Action and Expression: Enhance capacity for monitoring progress,"It is important to let students have a voice in choosing strategies.

Setting Criteria for Legibility:
Use specific language and visuals with students about what is meant my ""alignment"", ""illegible"", ""crowding"" and ""fully legible"" before asking them to use a checklist that includes these or similar terms. For example: aligned columns have numbers directly under the one above, poor alignment to the bottom line looks like floating or diving, crowding looks like numbers and symbols touching and/or you can't tell what's going on, fully legible means anyone who picks up the paper can read it and follow along the steps without confusion.
