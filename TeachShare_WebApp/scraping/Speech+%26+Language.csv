It is important to keep in mind the student's cognitive and language level when selecting an appropriate app for language use. For example, using an app that is above the student's cognitive and language abilities could lead to the student feeling anxious and frustrating and often abandoning use of the device altogether. In order for any use of technology to be successful in learning, it must be something that the student can eventually learn to use independently to communicate with others.
