A schedule with icons or photographs of the precise steps that will be needed to complete a task allows a student--even a non-reader--follow and imitate the steps. Here, the schedule would provide the steps for telling someone (e.g. the teacher) that something is needed. Photographs of the student himself doing each step of the task can be a wonderful way of engaging the student with the schedule and maintaining interest over time.

In this case, the teacher can adapt how students respond to the task question in several ways. The teacher may present students with two containers to compare, asking the students to select (verbally or physically) the container which has more or less volume, or the teacher may decide to ask students a yes or no question about each container (e.g. “Does this container have more than the other?”).

The teacher may then provide the students with [[ realia | objects ]] that represent parts of the math problem to use for the volume comparison task (“Here is the cup for Jolie and here is the cup to use for Matthew.”).

One option is for the teacher to draw a growing dot pattern on paper using a marker or paint that is raised. This will allow students to both see and feel the dots of the pattern. Another option is to create the growing pattern using [[ https://www.pinterest.com/braillethis/science-math-tactile-resourcestactile-adaption-kit/ | foam stickers or buttons ]] that are affixed to paper.

One option is to have students view the first steps in a growing pattern and then select from a finite number of [[ multiple choice | choices ]] that show a final step. In this structure, the teacher can increase or decrease the number of options based on student need. The teacher may decide instead to present one or more possible final pattern steps for students and ask them, one at a time, to determine if they are, in fact, correct. This structure will work well for some students who may be more successful if given the opportunity to examine closely one match option at a time, rather than considering multiple options at one time.

To create an animation of a growing pattern, the teacher can take a series of pictures of the steps in a growing pattern and then use a simple animation program to thread the pictures together. This presentation of the pattern may support students’ understanding of how the pattern develops. Many programs allow the user to modulate the speed of the animation, which may also be helpful as teachers adapt materials to meet individual students’ needs.

In this case, where students are asked to compare two quantities, many students will benefit from using [[ counters | counters ]] or [[ realia | physical objects ]] to make comparing two values more concrete. Teachers can create sets of objects to represent values that students will compare. If classmates are used as models, it will be important for teachers to show the peer buddies how to model counting out the number of objects in a set to determine value. Students should be prompted to pay attention to how the peer buddies count out objects, find the total the amount of objects in each set, and compare the two sets to determine which has more value. Then, as students are asked to do the task on their own, they should have access to the same objects. Some students may have an easier time using plain counters for this activity, perhaps in different colors, while other students may be more interested in and engaged with the task if they are given sets of classroom objects to use.

For some students, the teacher may phrase the question in a way that requires students to select the quantity with more or less by pointing to a set, or using an adaptive device such as a pointer or switch. Another way to modify the question is for the teacher to ask about each set “Does this group have more?”, prompting students to respond with a yes or no.  Alternatively, the teacher can provide a [[ cloze sentences | fill in the blank ]] sentence that students can complete by selecting terms from a [[word bank | word bank ]].

Alternatively, the teacher might structure the task as a memory game in which 3-4 shape cards are placed face down.

Because this goal addresses matching shapes and not recall of objects, it would be important to allow students as many “flips” as necessary to find matching shapes.

In this case, where students are being asked to match shapes that may have different orientations, it will be especially helpful for students to have pattern blocks that correspond to the shapes used in the task to rotate and compare. This will allow students to compare shapes side by side and to see how shapes that might appear different because of the direction they are facing are, in fact, the same. Some pattern blocks are translucent, and when using them in the classroom students can stack them on top of each other to see how shapes compare.

When an activity is introduced as a game it may be more appealing to students and thus better hold their attention. Here, where students are asked to find matches for shapes, lends itself nicely for a game structured for [[ play partners | two or more students ]]. The teacher may give students individual shape cards and then ask them to work together to find which student has a matching shape. Alternatively, the teacher might structure the task as a memory game in which 3-4 shape cards are placed face down. The students can take turns flipping up two cards at a time, seeking to find those that match. Because this goal addresses matching shapes and not recall of objects, it would be important to allow students as many “flips” as necessary to find matching shapes. Each time a student flips two cards over the teacher may ask the student “Do those shapes match?”, making each turn an opportunity to assess the student’s ability to correctly identify similar shapes.",UDL III 8.2 Provide Multiple Means of Engagement: Vary demands and resources to optimize challenge,"There are many ways that students can demonstrate understanding of a skill or concept. As a result, it is helpful to allow variation and choice in how students express responses to questions or in choosing what tasks they can complete to show proficiency with a skill. In this case, where students are asked to match shapes that may be oriented differently, the teacher has the option of structuring the activity in several ways. One option is to have students select from a finite number of [[ multiple choice | choices ]]. In this structure, the teacher can increase or decrease the number of options based on student need. The teacher may decide instead to present possible matches for students and ask them to determine if they are, in fact, correct. This structure will work well for some students who may be more successful if given the opportunity to examine closely one match option at a time, rather than considering several different shapes, as well as students who may benefit from expressing understanding by answering a yes or no question.",UDL II 5.3 Provide Multiple Means of Action and Expression: Build fluencies with graduated levels of support for practice and performance,"Whenever possible, it is helpful to present math concepts to students using [[ multiple representations | different modalities ]] to support varied learning styles. Specifically, when learning about shapes, it may be helpful for students to have access to images, written and verbal descriptions, and [[ math manipulatives | pattern blocks ]] while they are involved in lessons and learning tasks. In this case, where students are being asked to match shapes that may have different orientations, it will be especially helpful for students to have pattern blocks that correspond to the shapes used in the task to rotate and compare. This will allow students to compare shapes side by side and to see how shapes that might appear different because of the direction they are facing are, in fact, the same. Some pattern blocks are translucent, and when using them in the classroom students can stack them on top of each other to see how shapes compare. The teacher may show students how to rotate the shapes to see how they look similar and different depending on how they are oriented. Then, the teacher may cue students to use pattern blocks as they are comparing the shape cards for the activity.",UDL I 2.5 Provide Multiple Means of Representation: Illustrate through multiple media,,,,,,

This is real.) paired with picture supports for key words (e.g., plant, needs, sun, real). On the opposite page, paste an fictional image with a similar simple statement (e.g., The plant eats spaghetti. This is not real.).

For students with hearing impairments, it can be especially helpful to provide [[reference materials|reference materials]] in the form of a visual dictionary that displays pictures of coins and bills with their respective signs, names and values.

For a multitude of reasons, students may find it problematic to answer questions about their emotional state. By offering an adaptive computer software such as Clicker 6 to practice responding to questions using visual and auditory cues, these students may find it easier to express their thoughts and ideas. Finding media formats that work for every student allows the teacher to create activities specific to the student's interests, language, and cognitive level.
