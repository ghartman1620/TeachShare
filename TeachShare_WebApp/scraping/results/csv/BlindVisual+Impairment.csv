This strategy can be implemented in two ways: hand-under-hand guidance (i.e. physical assistance), or by the teacher physically completing part of the task, then asking the student to finish. Before using hand-under-hand guidance, the teacher should first ask or notify the student that they will touch the student’s hands. Then, teacher can provide hand-under-hand assistance to model the task processes on the note taking device. 

Actions that may require graduated guidance:<br>
• Pressing correct combinations of letters with spacebar.<br>

Alternative keyboards can be adapted in many ways: with enlarged or highlighted keys, for example, or with tactile and/or visual markers that correspond to “keyboard commands” for navigating a word processor. 

*Example adaptive keyboard scenario:*<br>
A student is using an alternative keyboard limited to 8 enlarged and high-contrast keys that control the Open, Enter, Save, and Arrow functions. The teacher says, “Press the “O” to open a new slide,” while guiding the student’s hand toward the key. The student presses the key which opens a Google Slide. The teacher then directs the student’s attention to two pictures of a solar eclipse and says, “Pick one for your presentation.” With physical guidance from the teacher, the student presses the 'Arrow' key to select the image, and hits 'Enter' to insert it on the page. Once the student composes a sentence to go with the image, the teacher says, “Press 'S' to save your work.""",UDL II 4.2 Provide Multiple Means of Action and Expression: Optimize access to tools and assistive technologies,"Give students a sequential [[visual task schedule| task schedule]] that “chunks” the task into steps.
