**Exemplar Student Response:**

In the article, “Good Enough to Eat”, it describes how insects provide many benefits to humans and society. First, they are very nutritious as they “are packed with protein, vitamins and minerals.” Additionally, as the world population increases and land becomes scarce, it will become increasingly difficult to raise livestock. Consequently, it will be necessary “to find alternatives to meat.” “Raising insects, which are able to live in crowded quarters, would require less land.” Finally, insects are also cheaper to feed. “Not only could bugs eat our scraps, but they also would require much less food—and water—than livestock.” Next time you see an insect, you may want to take a bite, since insect-eating is so beneficial!

**Example Prompt**

In (one to two) paragraphs, describe three characteristics of pandas that help them to survive.  Support your analysis with (three) details from the story. Your analysis should include details, examples, and/or a quote from the text to support your analysis.

**Example Student Response**

Pandas have several traits that help them to survive.  First, they are adaptable.  During the winter, pandas move lower down the mountain where it’s warmer.  They are also fierce.  When pandas feel threatened, they bob their heads, stare, and growl.  Pandas are very smart, too.  Although they live on the ground, they climb trees to escape predators. All of these characteristics lead to their survival.

In the book titled, How to Steal a Dog, Georgina feels like she needs to pretend because she doesn’t want Luanne to learn the truth about her. She doesn’t want her friend to know that her dad left her with “nothing but three rolls of quarters and a mayonnaise jar full of wadded-up dollar bills.” Specifically, she doesn’t want Luanne to know that she has been “sleeping in the back seat of a Chevrolet for a week.” In the story, Luanne is inquisitive and asks, ""What's wrong with Toby?"". Clearly, Toby isn’t feeling well and shouldn’t attend school with an earache. Georgina tries to change the subject but Luanne continues to be nosey by saying “No offense, Georgina...But you’re starting to look kind of unkempt.” Georgina realizes she can’t keep her secret forever and Luanne will find out the truth, that her daddy left and she now lives in a car.

**Exemplar Student Response:**

In the book titled, How to Steal a Dog, Georgina feels like she needs to pretend because she doesn’t want Luanne to learn the truth about her. She doesn’t want her friend to know that her dad left her with “nothing but three rolls of quarters and a mayonnaise jar full of wadded-up dollar bills.” Specifically, she doesn’t want Luanne to know that she has been “sleeping in the back seat of a Chevrolet for a week.” In the story, Luanne is inquisitive and asks, ""What's wrong with Toby?"". Clearly, Toby isn’t feeling well and shouldn’t attend school with an earache. Georgina tries to change the subject but Luanne continues to be nosey by saying “No offense, Georgina...But you’re starting to look kind of unkempt.” Georgina realizes she can’t keep her secret forever and Luanne will find out the truth, that her daddy left and she now lives in a car.

[[Cloze sentences|Cloze sentences]] are a tool that teachers can use to help students add details to a sentence and visualize where an adjective belongs (i.e. before a noun). For example, instead of asking students to build upon the sentence ""The cows and sheep and goats eat grass"" completely on their own, teachers could provide cloze sentences that elicit certain responses. The cloze sentence ""The cows and sheep and goats _________ to eat ________ grass,"" prompts the student to describe the cows actions and the grass, while the alternative ""The ________ cows and __________ sheep and goats eat grass"" prompts the student to describe the animals. Changing the location of the ""blank"" in a cloze sentence can also help students understand and visualize correct word order.",UDL I 2.4 Provide Multiple Means of Representation: Promote understanding across languages,"Providing students with a [[word bank|word bank]] of words related to the text may help them use vocabulary they would not have otherwise incorporated into their sentence revisions.
