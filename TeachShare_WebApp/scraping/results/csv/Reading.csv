Teachers should stress the use of a thinking routine repeatedly after it is introduced, so each time students approach a text, they begin to use the procedure independently. A helpful routine to be used during or after reading involves asking text-dependent questions, such as: “What is the author’s perspective in the essay?” Such questions require students to return to their text for answers by concentrating on analysis, key details, and important vocabulary.

To help students focus, teachers can model routines for analyzing texts using [[mnemonics | mnemonics]]. For instance, TWA has readers: **T**hink before, **W**hile, and **A**fter they read. This simple mnemonic (TWA) reminds students to implement a reading routine whenever engaging with text. To begin, the teacher can give a [[pre-reading | pre-reading]] lesson to show that before they read, students should think about identifying the author’s purpose and reflecting on what they already know about the text’s subject. Once the teacher has modeled the strategies within TWA, students can use the tool themselves for self-management.",UDL I 3.4 Provide Multiple Means of Representation: Maximize transfer and generalization,"As ideas become more complex in the informational texts (e.g., scientific articles) they scrrutinze in high school, students more will need structures to help them organize the ideas and evidence. Creating a visual representation of one or more texts using a [[graphic organizesr | graphic organizer]] or [[concept mapping| concept map]] can help students gather evidence and insight from what they read. For example, students can take notes in a RAP chart, an evidence-based strategy for identifying main ideas. The teacher may present a [[visual cue cards | cue card]] for the mnemonic: **R**ead a paragraph, **A**sk yourself, “What is the main idea and two details?” **P**ut the information into your own words. Teachers model using the RAP strategy through a [[think aloud | think aloud]] and provide scafforlding (e.g., by showing how to underline and highlight text, use the graphic organizer, or refer to a cue card or poster) until students become fluent. For extra practice, students can practice RAP in [[partner reading | pairs]].  Eventually, students can use RAP independently with the graphic organizer fading out as students master the strategy. As they learn to monitor their reading by seeking out main ideas and details paragraph by paragraph, students experience increased success with comprehension and are motivated to keep reading.",UDL II 6.3 Provide Multiple Means of Action and Expression: Facilitate managing information and resources,"When reading increasingly complex informational texts in high school, students can become more effective readers by reflecting on how they read and by applying reading strategies. Teachers can develop metacognitive skills in students by training students to use a  [[thinking routine | thinking routine]]. These often incorporate a [[mnemonic | mnemonic]], such as BWA (**B**efore reading, **W**hile reading,**A**fter reading procedures). Teachers should stress the use of a thinking routine repeatedly after it is introduced, so each time students approach a text, they begin to use the procedure independently. A helpful routine to be used during or after reading involves asking text-dependent questions, such as: “What is the author’s perspective in the essay?” Such questions require students to return to their text for answers by concentrating on analysis, key details, and important vocabulary. Teachers ask prepared questions in careful sequence to focus students on their text and increase their understanding of key ideas. Later, students begin asking the questions to themselves as they read.",UDL III 9.3 Provide Multiple Means of Engagement: Develop self-assessment and reflection,,,,,,

Some students may have difficulty leaping into a two-step task, so it may be beneficial to provide the text with sections [[highlighting|pre-highlighted]] for analysis. Highlighting parts of the text in advance accomplishes two things: it eliminates an extra step, giving students more work time; and it also alleviates the potential problem that the student might choose to analyze a piece of text that is irrelevant to the prompt. This scaffold can be adjusted to the student's individual comfort level - for example, perhaps a few selections are highlighted and the student can choose one for analysis; or maybe only one selection is highlighted because it has the most clear evidence to support an analysis.","UDL I 3.2 Provide Multiple Means of Representation: Highlight patterns, critical features, big ideas, and relationships","Some students may benefit from access to an [[modified text|instructional-level text]] for this assignment. Students who have difficulty breaking down a text's structure, for example, may need a text with simpler vocabulary in order to understand how the text itself is organized. These students can be strategically grouped together, or the entire class can read different texts independently. Ensure, however, that students do not feel self-conscious if they are utilizing an instructional-level text. This can be accomplished by pairing students instead of asking them to work in large groups, so it is less obvious which students are reading which text.",UDL II 5.3 Provide Multiple Means of Action and Expression: Build fluencies with graduated levels of support for practice and performance,"Writing can be a demanding task for some students, and it's not always necessary for students to write in order to make a strong literary analysis.
