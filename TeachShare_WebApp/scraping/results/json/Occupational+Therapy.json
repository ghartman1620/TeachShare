For example, the top of a photocopy paper box fits neatly inside most desks that have a storage space under the writing surface. This can serve as a drawer that a student can pull out to find books, folders and other materials with more ease than feeling around inside the desk itself. If this solution won't work with the furniture in the classroom, think about having a separate storage box for folders with papers by subject, and have a policy of no papers in the desk.",

Students can work together to mark a large taped letter or number on the floor (at this age, with adult assistance), or walk as a \u201cletter parade\u201d on letters, numbers or site words taped on the floor. Air Guitar Letters are easily done in a big group, or in pairs with one student helping to guide the arm of his or her partner. Students can work in partners to construct letters as a tabletop activity, taking turns choosing what letter their partners should form and giving feedback on the result. On a bigger scale, whole classes can do pre-writing warm-up activities together. Music can be very engaging and a good community builder. Songs about writing such as the [[ http://www.hwtears.com/hwt| Handwriting Without Tears]] song \u201cWhere do You Start Your Letters? At the TOP,\u201d both teaches students about a principle of efficient letter formation, and also gives them the feeling that they are all in this process of learning to write together.",

Digital templates also reduces student's frustration levels by providing models for formatting and organizing math written work in a logical and orderly way.

There are certain sensations that are generally calming and work for most students with defensiveness including firm, deep pressure, heavy work for muscles, and slow, rhythmic movement. These sensations can be produced in a variety of ways and every student will have unique responses to different sensory diet activities. For example, students with auditory defensiveness may benefit from firm pressure applied through compression garments, weighted blankets, snug hats or headphones, hugs, etc. Teachers should always work closely with the occupation therapist when designing and maintaining a sensory diet for a student.",

Others may need to have an adult hold the ruler for them. Students with visual impairments would benefit from rulers and lengths to be measured that have raised lines to feel.",

Others may need reminders about staying focused when they are counting small lines that mark fractions of an inch, or making sure that they are counting those fraction lines in the right direction.

Then have him or her do it with a different set of equally familiar multiples on paper that has been marked with well spaced boxes to write the numbers in. Go through both lists with the student and add up the number of errors. Or, have a classmate try to read or plot the student's list of poorly spaced numbers on a graph. Then have the same classmate do the same thing with a well spaced list. Time both and keep a count of errors. It is possible that these experiments will not show a big difference, but chances are they will. Students motivated to do well will now have evidence of the benefit of adequate spacing, and hopefully be more motivated to work on it.",

A sensory diet is a schedule of short activities throughout the day that generate the type of sensations that are soothing or organizing. There are many possible activities that can go into a sensory diet, including carrying something heavy while walking, wearing a snug stretchy garment (e.g. vest or hat), wall or chair push ups, or positioning head down lower than heart. This is a proactive approach, which keeps the nervous system bathed in neurotransmitters produced by these sensations to decrease the frequency, intensity and duration of reactions to distressing noise or touch. While there are some sensations, such as firm deep pressure, sustained heavy work for muscles, and slow rhythmic movement, that tend to be soothing, everyone responds differently to sensory strategies, so a sensory diet must be personalized.",

This can serve as a drawer that a student can pull out to find books, folders and other materials with more ease than feeling around inside the desk itself. If this solution won't work with the furniture in the classroom, think about having a separate storage box for folders with papers by subject, and have a policy of no papers in the desk.",

This can benefit students with and without organizational challenges. Reinforce this model in classroom with [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/PDCA_Cycle.svg/2000px-PDCA_Cycle.svg.png | visuals]] in the room, in how assignments are framed (e.g. \"remember to \"check\" your essay thoroughly, look for things to correct, and decide if you need to \"adjust\" your original \"plan\"\"), and how feedback is given (e.g. \"you had a great \"plan\", but did you \"check\" your work carefully?\"). Variations on this model include Goal-Plan-Do-Check or Plan-Do-Check-Act. This is a common model used in many settings from corporate boardrooms to cognitive rehabilitation.

So, when giving supports for organizing materials needed for an assignment, a written list (or pictures for non-readers) might work well for many of them. Other students who have strengths in auditory comprehension over visual processing, would do better being told verbally what materials to gather. Some students do well with a visual combined with verbal instructions. Others can only process one modality at a time. It's sometimes a trial and error process to figure out what works best, but at the middle school level, effective strategies may already be known for many students.",

It is usually most effective to combine sensory-based strategies with behavioral limit setting on inappropriate behaviors, such as making noise, moving around the room, being inappropriately physical with peers, etc, while supporting their use of agreed upon strategies.",

Feedback when they are making alignment mistakes as well as when they are lining up their work nicely should be both visual and verbal, and explicitly drawing their attention to the relationship between the left edge of their writing and the left margin. Even if the student already has brightly marked margins, give him or her a ruler to line up with the margin to judge if the writing is properly aligned. Or, have the student line the ruler up against the left edge of the writing and draw a line down the page to see if it is right over the pre-existing margin. If not, is it closer and/or more vertical than the student has done in the past? Encourage the student to self-assess by asking, or getting him or her to ask himself or herself if the first letter of each line is touching the margin and is directly under the first letter of the line above it.",

When you see inconsistent gaps between some letters, talk about how letters within a word need to be close enough to talk to each other or whisper in each others' ears. Some of these phrases may be unfamiliar to students and need an explanation.

The Playdoh or putty offers much more resistance than paper, giving sensory \"feedback\" for the cutting action.

                "text": "Give young students who are new to controlling drawing/writing utensils accommodations that help put the hand and fingers in more ergonomic positions for developing more efficient grasps for making controlled marks. Tilting up the writing surface (e.g. with an easel or slant board) also tilts the wrist upward, which supports opposing the thumb to fingers and the ability of the fingers to move more freely. Offering young students very small pieces of crayon or chalk forces them to use thumb and pads or tips of fingers to hold on, rather than using the palm or pressing the crayon tightly with the thumb toward the knuckles and index finger, which makes it more difficulty to manipulate it with finger movements.",

                "text": "Avoid power struggles with students around trying to get them to change their grasp on pencils while in the act of drawing or forming letters, especially at these young ages. It is typically more effective to provide many opportunities that build hand strength and dexterity outside of using drawing utensils or modifying the conditions when they are (e.g. raised surfaces, different types of pencils or crayons). While a dynamic tripod grasp is the most efficient for most people, there are other functional grasp patterns, such as a quadrapod (thumb and three fingers) or positioning the shaft pencil in between the index and middle fingers while using a tripod of fingertips. Students who do not have a lot of hand strength may do better with one of these grasp patterns, and will just become frustrated with drawing and writing if frequently asked to make a change. Do take note, though, of students who are using inefficient grasps, such as in the palm, tightly squeezed thumb wrap, or using the ends of all fingertips. Invite your occupational therapist for input in these situations.",

For example, one student may have difficulty holding the paper steady with his or her non-dominant hand and experience frustration while trying to improve skill in the open-close motion or cutting right on the line. Your gentle assistance can put your student over the top for accomplishing what he or she is motivated to do, and he or she can work on coordinating two hands together later on. Another student may want very much to use scissors, but is too visually distracted to keep his or her eyes on the task. That student may work better in a quiet part of the room, where he or she can independently develop the skill. Teachers must use detective eyes to analyze what is going on with each student who is struggling before trying an intervention.",

It is typically more effective to provide many opportunities that build hand strength and dexterity outside of using drawing/writing utensils or modifying the conditions (e.g. raised surfaces, different types of pencils or crayons). While a dynamic tripod grasp is the most efficient for most people, there are other functional grasp patterns, such as a quadrapod (thumb and three fingers) or positioning the shaft pencil in between the index and middle fingers while using a tripod of fingertips to guide the tip. Students who do not have a lot of hand strength may do better with one of these grasp patterns, and will just become frustrated with drawing and writing if frequently asked to make a change. Do take note, though, of students who are using inefficient grasps, such as in the palm, tightly squeezed thumb wrap, or using the ends of all fingertips. Invite your occupational therapist for input in these situations.",

It's also more difficult standing up to use the awkward approach of tracing the ruler line by crossing the dominant hand over the hand holding the ruler.",

However, there are some things a student can access independently with prior instruction and practice at those times.

For example, an ice cube tray can be provided, with one object (e.g. coins, pegs, Cheerios) within each compartment, or individual objects can be presented sticking out of tightly squeezed on Playdoh or stiff putty, or a teacher or classmate can hold them out to the student one at a time. To retrieve each coin or Cheerio, the student needs to use thumb and fingertip. A less mature raking motion with would work on a flat surface, and not encourage the development of more precise manual dexterity. If you are holding them out one at a time, try exerting just a little bit of pressure on the object, so the student has to use a little more strength to pull it out.",

Having a line or shape drawn on his or her back or hand with eyes closed or having his or her finger guided to form the line or shape with eyes closed requires the student to form an internal image of them based only on tactile or kinesthetic sensation. Touching and manipulating three-dimensional shapes or raised line drawings of them with eyes opened or closed adds tactile information to the student's understanding of them. Forming lines and shapes with a stick on a clay tray (a cookie sheet covered with a layer of modeling clay) or drawing them on the ground with chalk require more muscle power, adding proprioceptive (muscle and joint use sensations) information. All of these pieces of sensory information become internal support for the student as he or she figures out how to make the marks with a drawing utensil on paper.",

This can be made into a game in which children around a circle make up a cross crawl action for everyone else to imitate.\nFine motor diagonal/midline crossing activities can include putting diagonal lines on a geo board, connecting dots in a diagonal, and moving pegs on a large pegboard to different positions including diagonals upon request.",

Have the student record at regular intervals (daily, weekly), including how much he/she was able to be independent. It is easy to fall into, and get stuck in the habit of just shoving everything inside the locker when there is no structure in place for being more organized. However, many students feel good about themselves when they can find what they need easily and independently. Having self-generated data on progress can support the student's sense of competence. In addition, becoming more organized and independent can help avoid frustration and embarrassment that so often bogs students down, especially adolescents at the middle and high school levels.",

However, students with significant physical upper extremity limitations can be frustrated by the motoric challenge. Team with the assistive technology specialist to find the right access mechanisms for individual students. Touch screens (e.g. phones, tablets, laptops) are used almost as commonly as a mouse and keyboard , and can be a good alternative to mousing for many students. However, it is not the answer for others, who may do better with alternative keyboard commands, switches, joysticks or other technologies. The right adaptations can make it possible for students with physical disabilities to access technology and share in the enthusiasm with their classmates.",

For example, teachers might need to specifically tell students which finger to depress on the mouse (e.g. for a left click, index finger for righties and middle finger for lefties), how to know when to depress the mouse and when to release (e.g. sometimes the arrow will turn to a pointing finger or just making sure the cursor is directly over the correct spot), or to keep the mouse flat on the pad/table surface. Students with motor or perceptual issues may not even realize why they are not successful, and very specific feedback based on their attempts can be very helpful.",
