Two of the verb tenses in the English language are simple present (I study) and simple past (I studied). \n2. To identify the subject of the verb, first identify the verb itself. Example: Jane planned a party for her best friend.\nIdentify the verb: \"planned.\"\nAsk, \"who or what \"planned\"? The answer is Jane. So, Jane is the subject of the verb: Jane planned. \n3. Singular subjects (e.g.  \"I,\" \"you,\" \"he,\" \"she,\" \"it,\" \"each,\" \"every,\" \"woman\") need singular verbs and plural subjects (e.g. \"we,\" \"you,\" \"they,\" \"employees\") need plural verbs. \n\nExample paragraph (10 sentences):\n\nYesterday, I bought tea in the coffee shop near my house (verb is \"bought,\" subject is \"I\"). The pastry case was full (verb is \"was,\" subject is \"pastry case\"). Two customers laughed out loud (verb is \"laughed,\" subject is \"two customers\"). They drank hot chocolate merrily (verb is \"drank,\" subject is \"they\"). The employee rang the order on the cash register (verb is \"rang,\" subject is \"the employee\"). Another employee offered help (verb is \"offered,\" subject is \"another employee\"). A third employee prepared the tea and a cup of coffee (verb is \"prepared,\" subject is \"a third employee\"). A man nearby told a joke (verb is \"told,\" subject is \"a man nearby\"). A woman in a red coat opened the door (verb is \"opened,\" subject is \"a woman\"). The wind blew briskly (verb is \"blew,\" subject is \"the wind\").",

In order to further engage students in pushing past these challenges to master figurative language, teachers can utilize reading passages and materials that capitalize on [[ Personal-Interest Problems | students' interests ]]. For example, when providing students with sentences containing figurative language, teachers can incorporate the student\u2019s friends, favorite pastimes and life events in the sentences themselves. As figurative language can often seem foreign to middle school students, incorporating personal interest can be an effective strategy to make the learning more relevant.",
