Write a 4-5 sentence essay stating your opinion. Include an opinion statement, reasons that support your opinion, and a conclusion sentence. Also, use at least 1 to 2 linking words to connect your supporting reasons.\n\n**Sample Rubric:** <br>\n- clear opinion statement that responds to the prompt<br>\n- at least 2 supporting details<br>\n- at least 2 linking words<br>\n- clear conclusion sentence that restates opinion statement<br>\n\n**Student Model Response:**<br>\nI believe that aliens do not exist. My first reason is that NASA has been investigating planets and haven't found any life yet. For example, they went to Mars and they didn't find life there because there isn't any water on the planet. If there was life on other planets, why haven't we heard from them yet? Therefore, since there isn't any proof, it would take a lot of convincing for me to believe in life on other planets.",

When pandas feel threatened, they bob their heads, stare, and growl.  Pandas are very smart, too.  Although they live on the ground, they climb trees to escape predators.

The cloze sentence \"The cows and sheep and goats _________ to eat ________ grass,\" prompts the student to describe the cows actions and the grass, while the alternative \"The ________ cows and __________ sheep and goats eat grass\" prompts the student to describe the animals.
