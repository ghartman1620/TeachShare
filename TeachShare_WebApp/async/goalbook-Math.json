How many cubes of side length 1/4 ft are needed to fill the sandbox? What is the volume of the sandbox? Answer: Use unit cubes of side length 1/4 ft. The length is 8/1 ft = 32/4 ft, which gives 32 unit cubes across the length. The width is 6-1/2 ft = 13/2 ft = 26/4 ft, which gives 26 unit cubes across the width. The height is 3/4 ft, which gives 3 cubes along the height. There are 32*26*3 = 2496 unit cubes of side length 1/4 ft. Volume of unit cube = (1/4 ft)*(1/4 ft)*(1/4 ft) = 1/64 ft^3. Volume of sandbox = 2496*(1/64) ft^3 = 39 ft^3.\n\nCheck using formula for volume: Volume = l*w*h = (8 ft)*(6-1/2 ft)*(3/4 ft) = (32/4 ft)*(26/4 ft)*(3/4 ft) = 2496/64 ft^3 = 39 ft^3.",

They both start the week with zero bucks. Sam gets two bucks for answering a question and Zach loses two bucks for calling out in class without raising his hand. What is the total number of bucks that Sam and Zach now have? Answer: 2 + (-2) = 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nExample 2: Adding Rational Numbers Using a Number Line: A mixture of water and antifreeze is used as a coolant fluid in an automobile engine. It has a boiling point of 265 degrees Fahrenheit and a freezing point of -34 degrees Fahrenheit. What is the difference between the boiling point and the freezing point of the coolant fluid? Label this difference on a number line. Answer: Beginning at 265 degrees Fahrenheit on the number line, we move 265 degrees to get to 0 degrees and then another 34 degrees to get to -34 degrees. This gives a difference of 265 + 34 = 299 degrees Fahrenheit or 265 - (-34) = 265 + 34 = 299 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nExample 3: Understanding Subtraction as Adding the Additive Inverse: A pelican flies 3 1/2 feet above the surface of the lake and then dives 5 feet to get a fish. How many feet below the surface was the fish when it was caught by the pelican? Answer: 3 1/2 - 5 = 3 1/2 + (-5). Starting at 3 1/2 on a number line, we move 5 to the left to get to -1 1/2 ft or 3 1/2 - 5 = 7/2 - 10/2 = -3/2 = -1 1/2 ft.",

(Name) will calculate the volume by multiplying the known area of the base (e.g. triangle, square, rectangle) by the height for (4 out of 5) problems.\n\nExample #1 (surface area of a 3D object): Sara needs to cover a 4\u201d x 6\u201d x 7\u201d (l x w x h) box with wrapping paper.  The wrapping paper costs $0.05/in. ^2. How much will it cost Sara to cover the entire box with wrapping paper?  \nStrategy: Draw the object and recognize that a box is a right rectangular prism composed of 6 rectangular faces.  Since you are covering the box with wrapping paper, you need to calculate the surface area of the box.  Find the area of each face of the box and sum the areas to find the total surface area. Then, use the surface area to calculate the cost to cover the box with wrapping paper.\n\nFront/back faces = 2 (l x h) = 2 (4 in. x 7 in.) = 2 (28 in.^2) = 56 in.^2\nTop/bottom faces = 2 (l x w) = 2 (4 in. x 6 in.) = 2 (24 in. ^2) = 48 in.^2\nSide faces = 2 (w x h) = 2 (6 in. x 7 in.) = 2 (42 in. ^2) = 84 in.^2\nSum faces = 56 in.^2 + 48 in.^2 + 84 in.^2 = 188 in.^2\n188 in.^2 x $0.05 = $9.40 (cost to cover entire box with wrapping paper)\n\nExample #2 (volume of a 3D object): Ken needs to fill a customer's rectangular swimming pool with water, but must first know the volume of the pool.  Ken measures the dimensions of the pool and determines them to be: 120' x 45' x 4'.  How many gallons of water can Ken place in the pool if 1 cubic foot (ft^3) = 7.48 gallons? (Note: Assume that the pool is a flat-bottomed pool and the depth of the pool is constant.)\n\nStrategy: Since you are filling the pool with water, you must calculate the volume of the pool - the amount of space that the pool occupies.  The dimensions that Ken determined are expressed as l x w x h, meaning that the pool is 120' long, 45' wide, and 4' deep.  The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism and the volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying the length times the width times the height (or depth).  Therefore, the volume of the pool is: 120 feet x 45 feet x 4 feet = 21,600 ft^3.  Since 1 ft^3 = 7.48 gallons, simply multiply the volume of the pool by 7.48 gallons to determine how many gallons of water can be placed in the pool: (21,600 ft^3) x (7.48 gallons/1 ft^3) = 161,568 gallons of water.",

Teachers can present art work that features the geometric figures, and how geometric objects such as parallel lines, perpendicular lines, angles, line segments are integral in architectural drawing. Teachers can also further practice the concept by developing a cross-curricular project in which students must use the two dimensional objects in a drawing, and they need to use the tools (rulers and protractors) to make accurate mathematical representation of the objects in a drawing of their choice.",

(Name) will correctly use the linear regression model to make predictions for values not given in the data set for (4 out of 5) problems.\n\nExample: A survey was taken of 10 8th graders to study whether the number of hours they spent watching TV each week was associated with their grade in math class. The following ordered pairs list the time spent watching TV each week (in hours) and the grade point average (A+ = 4.0) for each student. (14, 3.1), (10, 3), (20, 2.2), (7, 3.8), (25, 2.4), (9, 3.4), (15, 2.9), (13, 3.2), (4, 3.7), (7, 3.5) The line of best fit for this bivariate data set is y_hat = -0.075*x + 4.0. Interpret the slope and intercept in context for this linear model. What GPA would be predicted for a student who watches TV for 18 hours during the week? Answer: Slope = -0.075 For every additional hour of TV watched, the student's GPA decreases by 0.075. Intercept = 4.0 For 0 hours of TV watched, the student's GPA is 4.0. For x = 18 hours, y_hat = -0.075*18 + 4.0 = 2.65. The linear model predicts that a student who watches TV for 18 hours during the week will have a GPA equal to 2.65.",

Answer: N = student is a 9th grader, F = student is a female. P(N | F) = P(N and F) / P(F) = .15/.48 = .3125.\n\nExample 2: Twenty-eight percent of the students are in 9th grade; P(N) = .28.

Answer: # even numbers on die = 3 (i.e. 2, 4, 6), total # of all possible numbers on die = 6 (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6); P(rolling even #) = 3/6 = 1/2. The likelihood of rolling an even number is an even chance since the probability is 1/2.\n\nExample 2: A multicolored spinner has 5 colors (blue, red, green, orange, yellow) with equal areas. What is the probability that the arrow lands on blue or orange after spinning it? Answer: # colored areas that are blue or orange = 2, total # of colored areas = 5; P(blue or orange) = 2/5.

Answer: The two graphs compare the heights of men and women. The heights of the men have a symmetric shape which is different than the right skewed shape of the women's heights. The median height of the men, 66 inches, is higher than the median height of the women, 64 inches. The range of the men's heights and the women's heights are both 10 inches.

(Name) will construct a graph by plotting each constraint, equation, or inequality on the coordinate plane and use the graph to identify possible solutions for (4 out of 5) problems.\n\nExample 1: \n\nCarl has $15 in his pocket. He goes to the school bookstore and looks at the prices. If pencils are $0.75 and notebooks are $1.25, how many pencils and notebooks can he buy if he spends all of the money in his pocket?\n\nAnswer: x = the number of pencils; y  = the number of notebooks; 0.75x + 1.25y = 15; Graph the linear equation and use the distinct points as solutions because Carl cannot buy a fraction of a notebook or a fraction of a pencil; Carl can buy 0 pencils and 12 notebooks, 5 pencils and 9 notebooks, 10 pencils and 6 notebooks, 15 pencils and 3 notebooks or 20 pencils and 0 notebooks. \n\nExample 2:\n\nCarl has $15 in his pocket. He goes to the school bookstore and looks at the prices. If pencils are $0.75 and notebooks are $1.25, how many pencils and notebooks can he buy if he does not want to spend all of the money in his pocket?\n\nAnswer: x = the number of pencils; y  = the number of notebooks; 0.75x + 1.25y < 15; Graph the linear inequality and shade the area below the dashed line. The solutions are the whole number pairs that are in the first quadrant and closest to the dashed line but below (e.g. 0 pencils and 11 notebooks, 5 pencils and 8 notebooks). \n\n\nExample 3:\n\nThe choir at Marshall High School sold tickets to their fall concert for $2 for students and $5 for adults. On the first night of the concert, the ticket sales totaled $740 with 232 tickets sold. How many adult tickets were sold on the first night?\n\nAnswer: x = the number of student tickets sold; y = the number of adult tickets sold; 2x + 5y = 740; x + y = 232; Graph the linear equations and find the value of y at the point of intersection; y = 92. There were 92 adult tickets sold on the first night. \n\nExample 4:\n\nThe choir at Marshall High School sold tickets to their fall concert for $2 for students and $5 for adults. On the first night of the concert, the ticket sales were less than $740 with fewer than 232 tickets sold. Create a model to represent the number of student tickets and adult tickets that could have been sold. \n\nAnswer: x = the number of student tickets sold; y = the number of adult tickets sold; 2x + 5y < 740; x + y < 232; Graph the inequalities and look for the shaded area that is a solution for both inequalities. Any whole number ordered pairs in the shared shaded area in the first quadrant are solutions (e.g. 30 student tickets and 22 adult tickets, 105 student tickets and 50 adult tickets).",
