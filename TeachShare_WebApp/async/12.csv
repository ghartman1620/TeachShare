Many soothing strategies are not feasible right in the situation of being in close proximity with others and would need to be used in a proactive way at other times. However, there are some things a student can access independently with prior instruction and practice at those times.

Setting Criteria for Legibility:
Use specific language and visuals with students about what is meant my ""alignment"", ""illegible"", ""crowding"" and ""fully legible"" before asking them to use a checklist that includes these or similar terms. For example: aligned columns have numbers directly under the one above, poor alignment to the bottom line looks like floating or diving, crowding looks like numbers and symbols touching and/or you can't tell what's going on, fully legible means anyone who picks up the paper can read it and follow along the steps without confusion.
