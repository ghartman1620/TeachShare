Label this difference on a number line. Answer: Beginning at 265 degrees Fahrenheit on the number line, we move 265 degrees to get to 0 degrees and then another 34 degrees to get to -34 degrees. This gives a difference of 265 + 34 = 299 degrees Fahrenheit or 265 - (-34) = 265 + 34 = 299 degrees Fahrenheit.

Example 1: The mini golf course charges different rates for children (ages 4-12) than for everyone older (ages 13 and up). A family pays $40 for two adults and four children. Another family pays $14.50 for one adult and one child. The system of equations in slope-intercept form is: y = -2x + 20 and y = -x + 14.5. Solve the system of linear equations using substitution for the price of tickets for children, x, and for those older, y. Answer: Select the answer choice x = 5.50 and y = 9.

Example #1 (surface area of a 3D object): Sara needs to cover a 4” x 6” x 7” (l x w x h) box with wrapping paper.  The wrapping paper costs $0.05/in. ^2. How much will it cost Sara to cover the entire box with wrapping paper?  
Strategy: Draw the object and recognize that a box is a right rectangular prism composed of 6 rectangular faces.  Since you are covering the box with wrapping paper, you need to calculate the surface area of the box.  Find the area of each face of the box and sum the areas to find the total surface area. Then, use the surface area to calculate the cost to cover the box with wrapping paper.

Front/back faces = 2 (l x h) = 2 (4 in. x 7 in.) = 2 (28 in.^2) = 56 in.^2
Top/bottom faces = 2 (l x w) = 2 (4 in. x 6 in.) = 2 (24 in. ^2) = 48 in.^2
Side faces = 2 (w x h) = 2 (6 in. x 7 in.) = 2 (42 in. ^2) = 84 in.^2

Strategy: Since you are filling the pool with water, you must calculate the volume of the pool - the amount of space that the pool occupies.

For problems where a solution exists, (name) will interpret the point of intersection of the lines as the solution for (4 out of 5) problems.

For example, a [[ problem solving checklist | problem-solving checklist ]] for graphing a system of linear equations that are in slope-intercept form is: Step 1: Plot the y-intercept for the first equation (0, b), Step 2: Plot the x-intercept (Plug in 0 for y and solve the equation for x), Step 3: Draw a line through the points, Step 4: Repeat Steps 1 - 3 for the second equation, Step 5: Identify the solution as the point of intersection.

Example 1: y = -2x + 3 and y = -2x + 5
Answer: y = -2x + 3, points at (0, 3) and (1, 1), draw a line that goes through the points,
y = -2x + 5, points at (0, 5) and (1, 3), draw a line that goes through the points.
Look at the graph to see if the lines intersect. The lines do not intersect so there is no solution.

Look at the graph to see if the lines intersect. The lines intersect one time at (1, 1).

Answer: P(t) = 1000e^(.25*t) = 1000(e^.25)^t = 1000(1.28)^t = 1000(1 + 0.28)^t; The population grows by .28 or 28% each hour.

The [[ problem solving checklist | checklist ]] to be used is:
1. Write out the multiplication rule for independent events (i.e. P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B)).
2. Identify which probability in the problem is P(A), which probability is P(B), and which probability is P(A and B).
3. Replace each part of the formula with only the number for the matching probability.
4. Multiply the two numbers on one side of the equation.
5. Determine if the two sides of the equation are equal.
6. Write a sentence: State whether the events are independent or dependent and justify based on the equality or inequality in Step 5.

**Example Prompt:** 


Calculate the value of x that makes the equation below true:

¾ (x + 8) = 9
