As students improve at identifying that a social conversation is taking place, allow them to respond only once until responses are accurate and they are able to take another turn in the conversation. If the student doesn’t provide an on-topic response, use a supporting visual with follow-up questions (e.g. a calendar if you are asking what the student did yesterday), or alter the question to make it more concrete (e.g. “You painted apples this morning in art class.

Students may have learned to identify that a question was asked in a structured learning environment and be able to answer a direct question, but social conversation settings require different skills to be used (e.g. identify that a conversation is starting, take turns, ask questions to keep a conversation going, respond to the conversation promptly and correctly). As students improve at identifying that a social conversation is taking place, allow them to respond only once until responses are accurate and they are able to take another turn in the conversation. If the student doesn’t provide an on-topic response, use a supporting visual with follow-up questions (e.g. a calendar if you are asking what the student did yesterday), or alter the question to make it more concrete (e.g. “You painted apples this morning in art class. What color did you paint?).",UDL I 3.4 Provide Multiple Means of Representation: Maximize transfer and generalization,"Use a [[ auditory preferential seating | separate quiet setting ]] to start teaching conversation skills to younger students. Social conversations require a student to use listening skills as well as visual skills to understand the entire message (e.g. words said, voice tone, body language, facial expressions). A separate quiet location allows a student to have auditory access to all of the information as well as less distractions to allow them to focus on the visual cues. A quiet location also allows for direct instruction opportunities to cue students, repeat the conversation starter or give them verbal models to accurately respond to a conversation starter.
