The teacher could say a word (e.g., \u201ccat\u201d) and then segment the sounds by [[ https://www.wilsonlanguage.com/WRS_Description.asp | tapping their thumb ]] to the index finger and saying the first sound of the word aloud (\u201c/k/\u201d), then tapping their thumb to the middle finger and saying the second sound of the word aloud (\u201c/a/\u201d), etc., while placing the corresponding tiles in order.

This can help students visualize the expected level of performance and teach them how to set obtainable academic goals while also motivating them to reach their goal. Teachers can also establish a given reward for reaching the expected number of words (e.g. when you can read 8 common words we can have a popcorn movie party).",

For example, teachers can have students independently practice putting on jackets  before going out to recess. As students line up and attempt to put on their jackets teachers can walk up and down the line and offer positive reinforcement for each correct step in putting on their jackets. As each student successfully puts on his jacket  independently, he can be released to recess. Having the activity immediately before a situation that requires it reinforces reasons for why it is important to learn how to perform the task and can increase motivation to learn the desired task.",

When a child is first learning this skill, the amount of hands-on guidance from a teacher might be fairly significant, but over time and with practice, this guidance can be gradually withdrawn until a child is independent with rolling. The hands-on techniques which can facilitate rolling will vary depending on the unique needs of the  individual student. A physical therapist can train teachers how to best apply physical assistance.",

For these children, teachers can utilize [[Discrete Trial Training|discrete trial training]], where the movement is broken down into smaller parts and those parts are practiced separately before practicing the whole skill. For rolling back to stomach, this can be done by working on rolling from sidelying to stomach as one skill, and back to sidelying as another skill. Once the child is close to independent in these two \u201chalves\u201d of the roll, the child will likely be more successful when attempting a roll from back to stomach. Note that because a child\u2019s physical therapist will know particular techniques that will work best and be safe for each individual child, it is important that a teacher partners with the PT to learn these techniques.",

                "text": "Pointing or gesturing to an object is an important foundational skill for language. Specifically, pointing is universal. It is a precursor to language and an early step in vocabulary building. Pointing is communicative and allows children to learn about different communicative functions (i.e., pointing in order to request an object vs. pointing to show an object). Children learn to associate and supplement basic words with gestures. Adults can encourage physical prompting with vocal modeling by pointing out objects and labeling them, allowing children to associate specific words with specific items. In order to encourage vocalizations to be paired with gestures, provide positive reinforcement to a student for demonstrating communicative intent. Instead of focusing on accuracy of word production, reward for communication dependent upon the child\u2019s skill level. For instance, if a child is only able to vocalize \u201cba\u201d for \u201cball\u201d and is pointing at a ball, provide them with the ball in order to encourage similar behavior.",

These schedules can be based upon the poster summaries that exist in the room, but these will often be more detailed, personalized, and easily handled and scrutinized by the student. Personalized photographs of a student who requires the use of these schedules can be included in the steps of the procedure, which can both attract and maintain student interest in the schedule. The teacher can explicitly teach the student the steps to a certain procedure (e.g. How to use a glue stick), and simultaneously photograph the student performing each step of the task. The next time that the student needs to perform the task, the teacher can introduce the student to the personalized schedule, complete with photographs of her/himself performing the task.",

The chart will have clear drawings (or better yet, photographs of the students themselves performing the steps) along with text. This poster may be referenced before a transition (e.g., \u201cTake a glance at the \u2018Walking Through the Hall\u2019 chart as you get on line, please!\u201d).

The teacher may \u201caccidentally\u201d observe students using rules in their play, or may explicitly direct students (e.g. \u201cI\u2019d like the three of you to pretend that you are at home, and Michael, you will break a rule.\u201d). The role play may very well lead to dynamic conversations with the student about rules, but the role play may be a necessary first step in activating the verbal talk.",

Having a student choose from an [[Emotions chart|emotion chart]] can be helpful. The student looks the chart over, chooses an emotion from the choice of faces, and then (spontaneously or with support from the teacher) chooses a way to relate the emotion to an experience the student has had (e.g. the student chooses angry, and next makes a pencil drawing about a time she was angry, or the student chooses confused, and next says \"I was at the store and got lost from my aunt.\").",
