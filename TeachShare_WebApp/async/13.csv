Examples of a Job Board:
Teacher takes a photo of each job with a job title written above it, and then pins the student's name above the corresponding photo for their job. The teacher should be sensitive to make a job board that is age-appropriate to middle school students, and it easy to understand. Photos are useful because they eliminate ambiguity for student's with communication and/or cognitive impairments. 

If a student is visually impaired, the teacher can place an object on the job board that is used for a specific job (e.g., attaching a pencil to the board for the job of pencil sharpener) with a pre-recorded job on a speech-generating device, such as a [[https://www.ablenetinc.com/bigmack|Big Mack button]].",Complete a Class Job,['School Environment'],"[{'_id': '552c4499645c280e75000016', 'created_at': '2015-04-05 17:38:11Z', 'text': ""Students will benefit from access to [[Video | video modeling]] of various job expectations.
