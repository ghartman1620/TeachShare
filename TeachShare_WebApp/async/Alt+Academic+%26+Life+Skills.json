Proper social skills can be divided into three stages: determining the social skills that need development, figuring out ways to teach the skills, and reinforcing lessons with the right resources. For example, if a student has trouble with attention span and staying on point, using social [[Visual Cue Cards| cue cards]] as supports may be helpful. Pick a topic and say three sentences -- two related to the topic and one random. Then ask your student to pick the sentence that's off-topic. For example, bring up the family dog. Talk about how long he played outside today and what he did at the dog park, and then say something about the weather. Ask your student to differentiate between the different sentences. The social cue cards can then be used to reinforce this concept: The cue cards offer ways of staying on topic during conversation.",

Younger students who are not familiar with [[visual task schedule|individual schedules]] may be overwhelmed by the quick change between activities. An unguided transition could elicit maladaptive behaviors (e.g. tantrumming, crying, hitting), especially when the activity is transitioning to a non-preferred task. [[ verbal prompting | Verbal prompting ]] can aid such transitions and can take many forms; a single word cue, a familiar phrase, and linking to a student-chosen, preferred reinforcer.

For students with more significant visual impairments, the teacher can provide screen readers, screen magnification tools and other assistive technology. These students may also benefit from [[preteaching|previewing]] the material covered in the video one-on-one with the teacher first, so that they have existing knowledge to draw upon while listening to the video's sound.",

For example, when assigning a student a video clip to watch for an assignment, the teacher can provide the student with five video clips to choose from and the student selects the video clip that interests him the most. Choosing a preferred task may recruit a learner by optimizing what is meaningful to the individual student. Students may also benefit from selecting an item from their [[sensory toolbox|sensory toolbox]] prior to viewing the video.

When a student becomes off task, he/she can view the card as a reminder to stay on task or the teacher can point to or touch the card while walking by the student as a discreet reminder to modify the behavior. The use of visual reminder\u2014like a cue card on a desk\u2014can be optimized by only using it during certain activities. If the card remains on the student's desk at all times, it is no longer a novel item, which makes it less effective as a visual reminder.",

The teacher assigns a partner to work with, and instead of reading through the sentences, the student will be asked to tell the story to his/her partner by simply interpreting what is on the pictures or illustrations of the story. Additionally the student may use [[Picture Choices | pictures]] to respond to teacher prompts. This activity may be made more challenging by providing the student with more than one picture option from which he/she must choose.",

Using a [[reinforcers | positive behavioral system]] (e.g., tokenboard, [[first-then board | first-then board]]) can provide the right amount of structure and stimulus to keep students engaged while learning new skills. If student continues to struggle, instead of using a delayed reinforcer with tokenboard, student can receive an immediate small reinforcers each time he/she performs task or is compliant (e.g., prompted to line up, student lines up then receives a token on tokenboard and a few seconds with preferred item; continues until student responds to just tokens on tokenboard with delayed reward). Allowing for student choice is another way to promote engagement. Whenever possible, allow students to [[choice boards|choose]] among behavioral options (e.g., \"When I reach out my hand, I expect a handshake or a high-five\"). This promotes engagement and accountability as the student takes ownership of the interaction by choosing how to respond.",

For a select item (e.g., apple, $0.45), place a picture of the apple with its cost at the top of the page followed by a visual of three combinations of coins that represent that value (e.g., one quarter and two dimes; four dimes and a nickel; nine nickels). Draw a thick border around each combination of coins to visually cue students that each box represents one combination. Have your student match coins directly onto his page as he counts up to the final value (e.g., one quarter and two dimes: \"twenty five cents, thirty five cents, forty five cents...forty five cents for an apple\"). As your student assimilates to the task, bump up the challenge by removing some of the coins and have your student finish the combination (e.g., one quarter, two XXX to make 45 cents).",

When teaching identification of combinations of coins to represent a given amount, initially providing repeated [[modeling behaviors|modeling]] can be essential to your student's success in learning the new concept. For example, if a student is to provide a combination of coins to represent 50 cents for a banana, model taking two quarters from the pile and have your student repeat, using pauses in between steps as needed. Point to each coin in left-right order as you say the cumulative amount of money represented by the coins (e.g., pointing to the first quarter say \"25 cents\" and pointing to the second quarter, say \"50 cents...I have 50 cents for a banana\").

Conventional 2D products can be augmented with the sensory boosts that moveable and touchable pieces can provide. The shapes that we offer students can be given as raised shapes, made with wiki-stix, or dried glue or wax outlines. Translucent tiles can be projected with the use of an overhead projector or smartboard, also increasing visual access to the shapes. Apps that allow for exploring shapes on a tablet or laptop can also expand access. For example, while a blue triangle on a piece of card stock may be visually appealing for some, other students\u2019 interest may be locked in with a matching blue tile that can be picked up and felt. Students can feel the sides and corners of a tile, accessing information about the shape that could be missed if only the visual representation is offered. Planning for and providing [[ multiple representations | multiple representations ]] is vital for anticipating and providing for all students needs.",

In the first stages of learning about a subject matter, some students will grow from the process of examining and thinking about answer choices, while removed from the situation of answering incorrectly: They learn about the process of reasoning in a safe environment, free from failure. Similarly, students may also be offered just one choice (e.g. While offering only 1 circle tile, \u201cPoint to the shape that is the same as this circle.\u201d).

Students are allowed to focus on one skill or learning outcome, and then given the responsibility of teaching their peers. Teachers might have students participate in a group that they\u2019ve already been taught about, assigning them one new focus point which deepens and/or broadens their understanding (e.g. while a group just watched another\u2019s presentation about triangles in which they learned that triangles have 3 sides, the new group may now be instructed to pay attention to the 3 points of a triangle).

The teacher may also vary the way in which students can provide their responses.

Reader\u2019s theater can be a wonderful opportunity for collaborative learning because students must work together to read a text, which increases students\u2019 attention and engagement. Often, reader\u2019s theater is used to dramatize fictional stories, however informational texts, too, can be adapted to be read dramatically by a group. The teacher may select the informational text with a clearly stated main idea and use it to create a script students follow as they read the text together. Alternatively, the teacher may give students a selection of texts from which to choose and then use a student-selected text to create a reader\u2019s theater script, as providing choice and including students in the selection of topic or text can also increase their level of participation. As students read in reader\u2019s theater, they can show each other the illustrations that correspond with their speaking parts. Once students have read/performed the text twice as a group, the teacher can then ask students individually to identify the main idea presented in the text.",

In this case, the teacher can adapt how students respond to the task question in several ways. The teacher may present students with two containers to compare, asking the students to select (verbally or physically) the container which has more or less volume, or the teacher may decide to ask students a yes or no question about each container (e.g. \u201cDoes this container have more than the other?\u201d). For some students, it may be helpful to offer a sorting mat with two sides labeled \u201cmore\u201d and \u201cless\u201d as a means of response.

One option is for the teacher to draw a growing dot pattern on paper using a marker or paint that is raised. This will allow students to both see and feel the dots of the pattern. Another option is to create the growing pattern using [[ https://www.pinterest.com/braillethis/science-math-tactile-resourcestactile-adaption-kit/ | foam stickers or buttons ]] that are affixed to paper. These can be both seen and felt by students. As the teacher models how to choose the next step in a growing pattern, he can [[ visual cueing | show students ]] how to feel the tactile graphics of the pattern and to note changes in each step (e.g. \u201cI see and feel one dot in this first row, and I see and feel two dots in the second,\u201d while pointing to and touching the representations).",

As a result, it is helpful to allow variation and choice in how to show proficiency with a skill. In this case, where students are asked to recognize the pattern rule in a growing pattern, the teacher has the option of structuring the activity in several ways. One option is to have students view the first steps in a growing pattern and then select from a finite number of [[ multiple choice | choices ]] that show a final step. In this structure, the teacher can increase or decrease the number of options based on student need. The teacher may decide instead to present one or more possible final pattern steps for students and ask them, one at a time, to determine if they are, in fact, correct. This structure will work well for some students who may be more successful if given the opportunity to examine closely one match option at a time, rather than considering multiple options at one time. A final option in this instance is for the teacher to ask students to describe what is happening in each step of the growing pattern (e.g. \u201cLook at the first 3 rows of this pattern. The rows are growing. How much do they grow by each time?\u201d).",

Students are interested in and often comfortable using technology and giving them the chance to incorporate technology into traditional paper and pencil tasks can help to sustain their attention. In this case, when students are working on recognizing pattern rules for visual patterns, the teacher may decide to use websites that include pre-created growing pattern problems or the teacher may create an animated growing pattern using pattern blocks and an animating app or program. To create an animation of a growing pattern, the teacher can take a series of pictures of the steps in a growing pattern and then use a simple animation program to thread the pictures together. This presentation of the pattern may support students\u2019 understanding of how the pattern develops. Many programs allow the user to modulate the speed of the animation, which may also be helpful as teachers adapt materials to meet individual students\u2019 needs. Alternatively, the teacher may work with students to create an animation together using the first steps in the pattern, asking the student to create the final picture to complete the animation.",

                "text": "Students are often more likely to connect to learning experiences to which they can personally relate. When presenting mathematical concepts such as addition, teachers have the option to craft word problems that are [[ personal-interest problems | individualized ]]. They may include relevant real-world scenarios, characters that students know, or the students themselves. In this case, the teacher can pose a real world scenario that might require addition (e.g. \u201cDanny picked 3 tomatoes and 2 cucumbers in the garden. His mom asked him how many vegetables he was able to find in all. What can we do to find the total amount?\u201d). Presenting these scenarios or word problems prior to asking students to complete the addition task will remind students that addition is relevant to real life. The teacher may also ask students to brainstorm real-life scenarios that go along with the task\u2019s addition problem. Integrating these personal connections with technology-based applications can go a long way in hooking students\u2019 interest.",

Teachers can create sets of objects to represent values that students will compare. If classmates are used as models, it will be important for teachers to show the peer buddies how to model counting out the number of objects in a set to determine value. Students should be prompted to pay attention to how the peer buddies count out objects, find the total the amount of objects in each set, and compare the two sets to determine which has more value. Then, as students are asked to do the task on their own, they should have access to the same objects. Some students may have an easier time using plain counters for this activity, perhaps in different colors, while other students may be more interested in and engaged with the task if they are given sets of classroom objects to use. Teachers can use their understanding of students to inform decisions when choosing which math manipulatives will be most effective.",

For some students, the teacher may phrase the question in a way that requires students to select the quantity with more or less by pointing to a set, or using an adaptive device such as a pointer or switch. Another way to modify the question is for the teacher to ask about each set \u201cDoes this group have more?\u201d, prompting students to respond with a yes or no.  Alternatively, the teacher can provide a [[ cloze sentences | fill in the blank ]] sentence that students can complete by selecting terms from a [[word bank | word bank ]].

The teacher may give students individual shape cards and then ask them to work together to find which student has a matching shape. Alternatively, the teacher might structure the task as a memory game in which 3-4 shape cards are placed face down. The students can take turns flipping up two cards at a time, seeking to find those that match. Because this goal addresses matching shapes and not recall of objects, it would be important to allow students as many \u201cflips\u201d as necessary to find matching shapes.

One option is to have students select from a finite number of [[ multiple choice | choices ]]. In this structure, the teacher can increase or decrease the number of options based on student need. The teacher may decide instead to present possible matches for students and ask them to determine if they are, in fact, correct.

                "text": "Whenever possible, it is helpful to present math concepts to students using [[ multiple representations | different modalities ]] to support varied learning styles. Specifically, when learning about shapes, it may be helpful for students to have access to images, written and verbal descriptions, and [[ math manipulatives | pattern blocks ]] while they are involved in lessons and learning tasks. In this case, where students are being asked to match shapes that may have different orientations, it will be especially helpful for students to have pattern blocks that correspond to the shapes used in the task to rotate and compare. This will allow students to compare shapes side by side and to see how shapes that might appear different because of the direction they are facing are, in fact, the same. Some pattern blocks are translucent, and when using them in the classroom students can stack them on top of each other to see how shapes compare. The teacher may show students how to rotate the shapes to see how they look similar and different depending on how they are oriented. Then, the teacher may cue students to use pattern blocks as they are comparing the shape cards for the activity.",

For example, young adults with moderate to severe support needs often need to be taught when and how to dress and undress as independently as possible. This can be taught using [[role play and dramatization|role play]], where students keep their clothes and practice putting their P.E. clothes on and taking it off, with their regular school clothes on underneath. As the student progresses in dressing/undressing during role play opportunities, the teacher can gradually fade the amount of support being given to the student, e.g., rather than having the student raise his/her arms so an adult can pull their sweater over their head and through their hands, the student would independently push his/her hands through the sleeves to put a sweater on independently.",

One way to create tactile shapes is to incorporate texture by gluing glitter onto the shapes, for example. Adding additional texture to the edges of each shape (e.g. lining the shape with pipe cleaners, popsicle sticks, tape etc.) can also provide the tactile stimulation that will help these students focus. Incorporating color into the shapes, especially brightly-colored hues, also is a helpful engagement tool.

Then, when the teacher asks the students questions about these story elements (e.g. \u201cWho is Spot?\u201d), the students can respond by picking the appropriate picture from an illustration in the book (or one that has been copied or created on a separate page) for this reading activity. For some students, it may be easiest to select illustrations by pointing or using an adaptive device (e.g. pointer, switch, eye-gaze), while others may provide a verbal response or circle a picture from the choices presented.",

It may also help students to more easily learn, recall and identify specific story elements, having had the opportunity to get the \u201cgist\u201d of the story during previous readings. The teacher may select the stories for this activity for students, or the teacher may give students a menu of books from which to choose, some familiar and some new.

In this instance, where students are asked to compare the lengths of bar graphs, the teacher may decide to present the two arrays for comparison in [[ multiple representations | multiple ]] forms. The teacher may show the student an image of two different arrays while also providing two tile arrays of corresponding amounts. The student can then compare the lengths of the arrays visually as well as holding and counting the tiles that make up the arrays as they compare their values. This strategy not only serves to support the representation of information, it may also help students as they provide their responses to the question about which row or array having more value. The students may select from the images of arrays presented by circling the correct array or pointing to it, or they may select from the math manipulatives by putting them on the proper side of a sorting mat. Tile or token-placement games like Connect Four can be fun and useful here, as can projecting translucent tiles on an overhead or smartboard projector.",

The teacher may choose to pair students according to reading levels or by areas of shared interest. Then, the teacher can guide students through a reading of the text, reading the text [[ read aloud | aloud ]] as students follow along in either books of their own or by viewing the text from which the teacher is reading. The teacher may read the entire text or passages from the text that include action, modeling strategies or thinking aloud about what is happening in the story to reinforce key moments and to point out illustrations that correspond with the story\u2019s action. This supports the students as they work to make meaning of what is happening in the text. Additionally, the teacher may have the students re-read the story [[ choral reading | aloud together ]] to further promote comprehension. This approach will help students to build fluency and may increase engagement, helping them to focus more specifically on the plot line of the story. Students may feel more comfortable reading aloud in a group setting as they will have the support and modeling of their peers.",

The teacher may give the students a menu of stories from which to choose for the reading activity, some of which are on a topic the teacher knows is of interest to the students. Providing choice is another way of engaging students as it helps them to feel more a part of the learning activity. Because students may be working in partnerships, the teacher may need to support peer discussions about which text to use. Alternatively, the teacher may select a story that she knows the students enjoy, or that the student has requested in the past. If there are different [[ alternate text | versions ]] of the story available in the classroom library, this too is an opportunity for teacher or student selection of a text to use.",

When students are asked to measure objects using informal units, the teacher model and think-aloud not only to reinforce understanding, but also to build relevance for students. Understanding why one might use a math skill can increase student engagement. For example, the teacher can introduce the activity by explaining that sometimes one needs to find ways to measure things using items other than traditional measurement tools, such as rulers. The teacher can introduce the option of unit cubes and pose the question, \u201cHow many unit cubes is this pencil?\u201d The teacher can show the steps to use unit cubes to measure the pencil verbally and through physical modeling. The teacher can count aloud, while pointing to the cubes, to determine the object\u2019s length and can write and speak the solution, offering various means of representation to support all students\u2019 understanding. Following the teacher demonstration, some students may be able to measure on their own, while others may need different levels of [[ graduated guidance | support ]] such as cueing, or, in some cases, hand-over-hand guidance lining up unit cubes alongside the object.",

For this task, where students are asked to recognize halves, the teacher may create a math story or even a [[ personal-interest problems | individualized word problem ]] that poses a problem that can be solved by identifying half of something (e.g. \u201cDaniel needs exactly 3 \u00bd trays of brownies, he finds 3 full trays but cannot figure out which of the partial trays on the shelf is exactly one-half a tray.\u201d). The teacher may further engage students by including them as characters in the math story or word problem. Once the teacher has introduced the task with an engaging story or problem to solve, the teacher can then continue to present the task to students using the shape cards, drawing a connection between the recognition activity and the story presented (e.g. \u201cThis shape card shows an amount just like the brownie pan because only part of the shape is shaded, just as only part of the pan had brownies in it. Can you figure out if this shows one-half?\u201d).",

For some students, having too great a number of answer choices can be confusing or distracting, and so the teacher may provide students with fewer possible choices. The teacher may present these choices together so that the student must make a selection from the two, or the teacher may decide to ask the student about each illustrated choice which shows the narrator, asking the student to respond with a yes or no (e.g. \u201cDoes this show who is telling the story?\u201d). The teacher may also vary the way in which students can provide their responses.

In learning about the role and function of a narrator, students may use [[ adapted text | adapted ]] texts in a [[ Reader\u2019s Theater | reader\u2019s theater ]]. Reader\u2019s theater can be a opportunity for collaborative learning because students must work together to read a text, which potentially increases students\u2019 attention to the story. Because students are being asked to identify the narrator of the story, it will be important for the teacher to clearly define the role of narrator in the reader\u2019s theater script and to remind students before they perform the text what the role of the narrator is (e.g. the character telling the story). The teacher can assign the students\u2019 roles or allow students to choose them. Whenever possible, allowing for choice can heighten engagement as students feel more a part of the learning task. Once students have read the story together twice, the teacher can then introduce the task of identifying the narrator. The teacher may also decide to use the reader\u2019s theater structure to allow students to identify the narrator by asking them to select the person who read the narrator\u2019s part in the story (e.g. \u201cWhich student read the part of the narrator?\u201d) as that selection will also demonstrate the student\u2019s understanding narrator in the text.",

Using a [[reinforcers | positive behavioral system]] (e.g., tokenboard, [[first-then board | first-then board]]) can provide the right amount of structure and stimulus to keep students engaged while learning new skills. However, the type and rate of feedback required varies based on individual needs. For example, a reward should be provided that allows students to de-escalate and refocus such as a [[6-second pause|sensory break]]. Timing of reinforcers is also important, as some students need immediate reinforcement at first. For example, student can receive an immediate small reinforcer each time he/she performs task or is compliant (e.g., prompted to line up, student lines up then receives a token on tokenboard and a few seconds with preferred item). This continues until student responds to just tokens on tokenboard with delayed reward, scaffolding the expectations.",

A peer and your student can take turns pasting images that fall into respective categories. This will provide your student with a model to learn correct sorting while also giving him a break in between turns.

[[Visual Task Schedule | Visual schedules]] provide one method of establishing routine and structure throughout the day. Students are able to determine their days, know what to expect, and can follow the visual cues. The schedule can then be embedded with [[Reinforcers | positive reinforcement systems]] such as tokenboards or [[First-Then Board | first-then boards]]. This presents information in a clear manner and allows there to be distinct connections between schedule, expectations, and outcome. When changes to the schedule are necessary, teachers can help students cope with the difference by [[Preteaching|demonstrating]] on the visual schedule how the day will be different. This preview, along with reminders leading up to the change, provides students time to prepare and process the new information which can help them stay calm during the unfamiliar transition.",

For a student with an attention deficit, provide a reference chart to teach the \"dollar up\" strategy when making purchases. Create a t-chart with the labels \"Dollars\" and \"Cents\" from left to right. In the \"Dollars\" column, have your student place the respective number of dollars.

For your student greatly impacted by a physical and cognitive impairment, counting out change can be difficult because it requires refined fine motor skills and memorization skills. Simplify this task while keeping the main objective by teaching the \"dollar up\" strategy, which requires only the use of paper bills when making purchases. Model and teach your student to always pay in the amount of the next dollar up so that your student doesn't have to count combinations of coins in addition to bills when purchasing with cash.

For example, a student can create and illustrate a cue card that is then handed to the student to hold during story time. When a student becomes off task, he/she may view the card as a reminder to stay on task or the teacher can point to or touch the card while walking by the student as a discreet reminder to modify the behavior. The use of visual reminder\u2014like a cue card\u2014can be optimized by only using it during certain activities. If the card remains with a student at all times, it is no longer a novel item, which makes it less effective as a reminder.",

Using [[modified text|larger print items]] and [[math manipulatives|manipulatives]] allows students to have better access to information. In addition, teaching with movements and with whole body techniques allows students who struggle with understanding words and numbers to apply new information in a different mode. \n\nAttention Support: Student uses a [[Role Play and Dramatization | whole-body technique.]] For example, there are two sets of circles or marks on the ground, students jump on the circles and count aloud then adds one more for the total. Teachers can slowly transition students to math manipulatives and then to drawing symbols as the student develops addition skills. \n\nVisual Support: Student learns strategies such using touch math with raised dots/circles, using manipulatives when practicing skills, or [[read aloud|verbally practicing]] counting one more.\n\nHearing Support: Students practice using a [[number line|number line]] and [[math dictionary|vocabulary concepts]] of \u201cadd one\u201d and \u201cone more.\u201d Student can also practice by using interactive games and activities such as a whiteboard for adding one more (e.g., given seven flowers, student drags one flower over then counts the total). \n\nPhysical Support: Students can use [[playing cards|large number cards]] that they can see and gesture toward and a large [[number line|number line]]. They can keep both cards and number lines on an eye-gaze array for access. \n\nExpressive Support: Teachers can allow students to engage with manipulatives and practice writing problems and answers on a whiteboard. Students can engage in creating math problems into a visual [[illustration|illustrations]], then calculate the total (e.g., given five manipulatives, student draws five circles on a mini whiteboard, when prompted to add one, student draws one more, then writes or selects the answer).",

Think creatively how you can incorporate student choice-making while working towards the same outcome or objective. Give your students some choice and autonomy will support development of self-determination, pride in accomplishment, and increase personal connections to their learning. For example, when working on this word-processing goal, have your student choose a category of his choice (e.g., characters in my favorite books) to hook initial engagement. Then, have your student create a [[visual task schedule|visual task schedule]] by selecting the order in which he will answer questions represented by a picture icon for each question (e.g., Gingerbread Boy, Charlotte, Harry Potter, Batman).",

A student who needs visual support adaptations, for example, can be offered enlarged pictures of angles that are placed on a high contrast background (e.g. hot pink angle on a black background). Another method might be to add texture to the angles using items such as sandpaper or pipe cleaners. For students who have difficulty staying on task, matching angles in a computer-based game might help them to maintain focus on the content. Teachers can also consider creating the angles with their students; typically, students enjoy participating in hands-on activities with their teachers, aides and peers. Creating usable tools is exciting and meaningful, and helps students make a stronger connection to the task.",

Teachers can use [[http://blog.metu.edu.tr/e166573/files/2012/05/uhhhhhhhhhhhhhrl.jpeg|fraction cubes or bars]] to create a tactile fraction. Often, fraction bars illustrate a fraction with different colors, but this wouldn\u2019t necessarily support students who need visual adaptations. To make a fraction bar tactile, a teacher can add a small circle of glue to a portion of the fraction bar, so the student can feel the dried glue to determine the fraction it represents. For instance, a fraction bar representing the number \u00be would have four sections, and the teacher would put small circles of glue on three of the sections so the student could identify the fraction using touch.",

Specifically, the teacher may limit the number of objects compared to two. The student may then respond using a preferred method (e.g. point to, pick up, eye gaze) to select the correct object. Alternatively, the teacher may ask students a question that requires a yes or no response about the lengths of the objects (\u201cIs this snake longer than the other?\u201d or \u201cIs this the shorter string\u201d).

Many online texts include tables of contents that are hyperlinked to particular chapters. Teachers can also create interactive texts that are individualized to students reading levels and interests (e.g. [[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivoFDzYTdEw | Powerpoint or Pages ]]), which also include an outline mode that functions in the same way as an interactive table of contents. This feature may not only highly engage students, but may help them to better understand the connection between headings (chapter titles) and their corresponding passages. When using an interactive text for this activity, the teacher can preview the features with students, noting in a modified picture walk the title, table of contents and the chapters themselves. Some students may benefit from having the teacher [[model academic task | model]] how to use the links in the interactive table of contents immediately before doing so independently. Another method of adapting a text\u2019s table of contents is to enhance it with illustrations. Some texts for early readers include illustrated tables of contents, but the teacher may also create a modified table of contents with pictures, adding the page to a traditional text. In this case, the teacher may choose to introduce the table of contents, cueing students to the illustrations that correspond with each heading before asking students to locate a chapter on a specific topic.",

In order to assess each students\u2019 ability to use chapter titles to find information, the teacher can present the task in the form of an investigation (e.g. \u201cNow that we have explored this book together, I am going to see if you can use the clues we found to locate certain information.

For some students, it may be necessary to procure or create math tools that are accessible to students with different needs. In this instance, where students are working with analog clocks, one option is to use analog clocks that have been adapted to provide multisensory support such as a larger-face, high-contrast numbers, color-coded hour and minute hands, or a talking feature. For teachers who do not have access to adaptive clocks, another option is to create [[ adapted text | enlarged or high-contrast ]] images of clock faces showing different times. These can be created on the computer for individual students or, if technology allows, may be projected onto a screen to use with a small group. Finally, some websites have free adjustable virtual analog clocks (e.g. [[ http://www.time-for-time.com/swf/myclox.swf | time-for-time.com ]]) that can be viewed on computers and tablets and manipulated with adaptive tools.",

Some students will be comfortable and able to point to the hour and minute hands when given a verbal cue to do so, while others will benefit from adaptive tools such as pointers or eye-gaze boards to make their selections. Others may have an easier time showing their understanding by labeling the different hands on an image of an analog clock, perhaps by writing the words \u201chour hand\u201d and \u201cminute hand\u201d on a diagram or by affixing pre-made labels with the same terms.

Students may be more interested in--and therefore more likely to pay attention to--learning skills that will be useful to them. In this case, where students are required to recognize the different hands on an analog clock, a natural way is to make connections between telling time to events or occurrences in their daily routine, either within or outside of the classroom, that are meaningful or fun for students. The teacher may preface this activity by having students share their favorite activities of the day and their respective times. Then, the teacher can explain the importance of remembering the different parts of a clock to tell time (e.g. \u201cEveryone said they loved recess! Recess is at 12:45, so if you want to be able to tell when it\u2019s recess time, you need to know how to tell when the hour hand is on the 12 and the minute hand is on 45.\u201d). The teacher might also associate this task with events from the daily class schedule or from students\u2019 individual schedules (e.g. \u201cReading starts at 9:15. How will we know when it is time to get our reading journals?\u201d) so that students can begin to apply the skill of recognizing the hands of a clock in their daily classroom experiences.",

First, the teacher may provide students with an illustrated and labeled [[ graphic organizers | sorting mat ]] to support the division of the objects into two groups. Depending on individual student\u2019s needs, the teacher may label the two sides of the sorting mat with text headings (e.g. \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cred\u201d) and also supply illustrations for each trait (e.g. a dot of a given color or the image of the colored object to correspond with the headings). The teacher can review the elements of the sorting mat with students prior to modeling the sorting task and then use the mat when modeling how to divide the objects into two groups. In addition to the sorting mat, the teacher may also provide students with a graphic organizer that outlines each array. Some students may have difficulty building an array from scratch, and having an outline of where to put the rows to make an array (or even to start it) will provide the support they need to demonstrate their understanding.",

First, the teacher may decide to adapt the pattern blocks so that they are labeled with images that fall into a certain category (e.g. stickers with different animals on them) and to give the students a [[ preferred topic or text | choice ]] of which type of blocks to use for this activity (e.g. \u201cWe have animal blocks and color blocks that we can use for this activity.

In this instance, the teacher may ask this question prior to modeling the task so that the students can see the classification process modeled using their selected trait.

Next, the teacher can give the student the option to choose which [[reinforcers|reinforcer]] to put in the \u201cThen\u201d section (e.g. computer time, play a game with a friend, hold a preferred tangible item).
