One way is that the teacher can verbally state a device part and ask the student to identify it on a picture (or actual device).

Another way would be to ask yes or no questions about the various parts of the hearing device. For example, the teacher can point to the battery door and say, \"Is this the cord?\" The student would then shake her head \"No,\" in response.

As students improve at identifying that a social conversation is taking place, allow them to respond only once until responses are accurate and they are able to take another turn in the conversation. If the student doesn\u2019t provide an on-topic response, use a supporting visual with follow-up questions (e.g. a calendar if you are asking what the student did yesterday), or alter the question to make it more concrete (e.g. \u201cYou painted apples this morning in art class.

Instead of verbally asking the teacher to change seats, a student can use a nonverbal communication method, such as gesturing, nodding in response to a yes/no question, activating an adaptive switch or using a communication device. For example, to elicit a yes/no response, the teacher can ask, \u201cDo you think sitting at the end of the semi-circle, near me, would help you hear the story better?\u201d Similarly, if the student uses a communication device, the teacher can ask questions that elicit student answers that have already been pre-programmed into the device. For students who prefer to communicate using images, the teacher can supply picture choices of alternate seating locations and ask them to choose the seating arrangement that works best. Students can point to, pick up, or use eye gaze to indicate their selection.",

Many times, a DHH student will sit in a group setting and let the other members of the group carry the conversation. This is easier, requires less listening, and is an easy way to mask the fact that they are missing information and not able to keep up with the conversation. A teacher can use a verbal prompt (e.g. What do you think?) that reminds the student that it is time to participate in the conversation. A visual prompt can also be taught and agreed upon with the target student, particularly if the student is averse to the spotlight that a verbal prompt can place upon her. A colored index card held up by the teacher, barely noticeable to anyone else, could cue the student that it is time to contribute. The teacher can also repeat the question, or repeat what another student said to ensure that the DHH student heard the message and can then be more successful in responding appropriately. If the response is not on topic, the teacher needs to repeat the message again, have the student respond again, and then model an on-topic response if still not successful. Have the group sit in the back of the classroom or move to the hall or another quiet area if the DHH student is continually not able to keep up with the group discussion. The background noise may be too much for the student to hear and follow along.",

Topics can be found by searching online for \u201cconversation starter games\u201d. The teacher reads the prompt and then each child takes a turn answering the questions by commenting on the topic. As each student takes their turn in the conversation task, have a game (e.g. Monopoly, UNO, Trouble) that each student can take a turn at playing once they have contributed their on-topic response to the conversation. After every correct on-topic contribution to a conversation starter, the student could take a turn at the motivating game. If the student answers incorrectly, repeat the conversation starter prompt and have him try it again. If still wrong, model a correct on-topic response and have the student try one more time. After three attempts, allow the student to take a turn at the motivation game (monopoly). The extra motivation of playing a fun game will help students continue to want to converse with each other and the teacher.\n\n\n*Example Conversation Topic Starter:*<br>\n\u2022 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go and why?<br>\n\u2022 DHH student: I would go to Europe and visit the Queen\u2019s Palace.",

A teacher can use a verbal prompt (e.g. What do you think?) that reminds the student that it is time to participate in the conversation. A visual prompt can also be taught and agreed upon with the target student, particularly if the student is averse to the spotlight that a verbal prompt can place upon her. A colored index card held up by the teacher, barely noticeable to anyone else, could cue the student that it is time to contribute. The teacher can also repeat the question, or repeat what another student said to ensure that the DHH student heard the message and can then be more successful in responding appropriately. If the response is not on topic, the teacher needs to repeat the message again, have the student respond again, and then model an on-topic response if still not successful. Have the group sit in the back of the classroom or move to the hall or another quiet area if the DHH student is continually not able to keep up with the group discussion.

The prompt should be brief and direct, and students should know what to do once they receive the prompt. For example, if the teacher taps his ear and says, \"Battery check,\" students should know that he is telling them replace to a dead battery. Protocol for battery replacement should also be discussed prior to using a verbal prompt. For example, once prompted by the teacher, students will quickly move to a designated area in the classroom (e.g. a cubby that holds extra batteries) to change the battery, and return to the assigned task immediately after.",

Another way would be to ask yes or no questions about the various parts of the hearing device. For example, the teacher can point to the battery door and say, \"Is this the cord?\" The student would then shake her head \"No,\" in response.

The images can be detailed and specific (e.g. a photo of a student implementing the accommodation), or more symbolic (e.g. a visual clip art icon to represent the accommodation).

Instead of verbally choosing an accommodation, a student can use a nonverbal communication method, such as gesturing, nodding in response to a yes/no question, activating an adaptive switch or using a communication device. For example, to elicit a yes/no response, the teacher can ask, \u201cDo you think sitting at the end of the semi-circle, near me, would help you hear the story better?\u201d Similarly, if the student uses a communication device, the teacher can ask questions that elicit student answers that have already been pre-programmed into the device. For students who prefer to communicate using images, the teacher can supply accommodation picture choices and ask them to choose what works best. Students can point to, pick up, or use eye gaze to indicate their selections.",
