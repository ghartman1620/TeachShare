For extra practice, students can practice RAP in [[partner reading | pairs]].  Eventually, students can use RAP independently with the graphic organizer fading out as students master the strategy. As they learn to monitor their reading by seeking out main ideas and details paragraph by paragraph, students experience increased success with comprehension and are motivated to keep reading.",

Teachers should stress the use of a thinking routine repeatedly after it is introduced, so each time students approach a text, they begin to use the procedure independently.

Some students may have difficulty leaping into a two-step task, so it could be beneficial to [[highlighting|pre-highlight]] relevant instances when the key term is used by the author. Highlighting parts of the text in advance accomplishes two things: it eliminates an extra step, giving students more work time; and it also alleviates the potential problem that the student could choose to analyze an irrelevant word or piece of text. This scaffold can be adjusted to the student's individual comfort level - for example, perhaps a few selections are highlighted and the student can choose one for analysis; or maybe only one selection is highlighted because it has the most clear evidence to support an analysis.",

Cite at least **three** pieces of evidence from the text. Write 1-2 paragraphs. <br>\n\n**Example Response**<br/>\nClare Wilson, the author of \u201cThe Death of Smoking,\u201d ties information together in different and interesting ways. She talks about the history of cigarettes and how they were first promoted, and connects this to modern medicine. She explains that the number of smokers have decreased over time: \u201cIn the US, adult smoking rates are now down to about 15 per cent.\u201d This is connected to the information in earlier paragraphs by showing the link between health warnings and a decrease in smokers. Wilson compares America to other countries, too: \u201cNew Zealand, which has long had some of the world\u2019s strictest tobacco control laws, aims to get adult smoking down to below 5 percent by 2025. Finland is aiming for this by 2030, including the use of chewing tobacco and e-cigarettes.\u201d All of the information about other nations is connected to the main idea by comparing and contrasting. \n\nThe rest of the article uses expert testimony to prove a main idea, like this quote from an expert: \u201cThe best approach, says Glantz, is to continue raising taxes, and further restrict advertising and where people can smoke in public.\u201d Stanton Glantz is from the University of California and has been studying tobacco control for a long time. Wilson uses quotes from Glantz and his ideas and findings to connect the rest of the ideas in the article: \u201c\u2018The current policies are working,\u2019 he says. \u2018We just need to do them more.\u2019\u201d Referring to an expert\u2019s ideas provides a connecting thread throughout the article. Quotes from an expert are used to explain that tobacco use is going down and more restrictions and warnings might be able to get rid of it once and for all. <br>\n\n**Example Rubric** <br>\n![](https://d343hwwwhotitb.cloudfront.net/tasks/kraked-1521944066-itemimage_RI.9-10.3_final_Tk%20goal%20rubric.png)",

State the claim and analyze the interaction between individuals (such as the students and families in the article) and events (such as schools requiring high-speed Internet access for homework). Cite at least **three** pieces of evidence from the text to support your response. Write at least 2 paragraphs.\n\n**Example Response**<br/>\nThe author claims there is a relationship between the availability of technology and educational equality, specifically, that access to technology opens up educational opportunities for students who can use the Internet in their home, but limits opportunities for students without residential access, such as those living in rural areas or in low-income families. The author further develops this claim by illustrating how teachers require use of the internet to complete homework, yet an \u201cestimated five million families who are without it and are struggling to keep up.\u201d The author of the article describes two students and how they are affected by this: \u201c...every weeknight, the siblings stood outside the low-slung school, sometimes for hours, to complete homework for the sixth grade.\u201d Their mother is quoted discussing the family budget and her worries about increased demand for Internet to complete homework as the children grow older. <br>\n\nThis creates  a \u201cdigital divide,\u201d or \u201cstark disparity in access to technology.\u201d Those without access suffer because the consequence for these students is that they miss connections that are \u201cessential for school and future job opportunity.\u201d The last half of the article shows that U.S. educational technology and the \u201cdigital divide\u201d is a significant issue impacting students and schools; therefore, government agencies, such as the F.C.C. and advocacy groups, are working on a major reform effort. <br>\n\n**Example Scoring Rubric**<br/>\n![](https://d343hwwwhotitb.cloudfront.net/tasks/kraked-1521944724-itemimage_RI.11-12.3%20TK%20goal%20rubric%20PNG.png)",

Miguel reveals that although he had just \u201cwritten some pretty bad stuff about\u201d Rondell in his journal, he determined Rondell could not read. He presented the fact that Rondell stared \u201cright at the sentence I\u2019d just written about him\u201d and \u201che didn\u2019t do nothin\u2019.\u201d Based on his accurate analysis of another character, Miguel\u2019s perceptive and logical nature was developed as a character trait and supported by his confident assumptions about Rondell. Even though Miguel appears smart and analytical in the beginning of the excerpt, when Rondell pins him down later in the story, Miguel \u201calmost wanted Rondell to push down harder with his shoe.\u201d He imagined them calling to tell \u201cmy moms what happened\u201d and pictured her \u201ccrying but at the same time looking sort of relieved\u201d that Rondell had injured him or even took his life. Miguel imagining his fate reveals how guilty he feels. His interaction with another character and a glimpse into Miguel's thoughts reveals that while he seems smart, analytical, and confident at first,  he changes during the scene and the conflict reveal his vulnerable side.\n\n**Example Rubric** <br>\n\n![](https://d343hwwwhotitb.cloudfront.net/tasks/kraked-1522436934-itemimage_RL.9-10.3%20TK%20goal%20rubric%20final.png)",

Reading a [[ familiar text | familiar or well-known ]] book can support many students in learning to talk about books, particularly helping them remember and be ready to discuss details from the story. By removing the newness of a text, teachers can let their students focus on learning the skills of discussion, rather than remembering the details of the text. For example, if a student has heard the same read-aloud about starfish three times, they are more prepared to recall and share information that was learned from the text.",

This scaffold can be adjusted to the student's individual comfort level - for example, perhaps a few selections are highlighted and the student can choose one for analysis; or maybe only one selection is highlighted because it has the most clear evidence to support an analysis.",

Write two paragraphs.\n\n**Example Response**<br/>\nIn \u201cWild Geese\u201d by Mary Oliver, two interrelated themes are developed throughout the poem, including the first theme of of letting oneself experience imperfection to a second, related theme of finding a sense of belonging through nature. The first theme presented at the beginning of the poem is imperfection, the idea that it is okay not to be perfect and to express one\u2019s feelings. It is almost as though the poet is giving the reader permission to experience these feelings: \u201cYou do not have to be good... Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.\u201d This message is important, since many times we are told to focus on the good or just be grateful for what we have.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThis theme is intertwined with another, more prominent theme about a sense of belonging as the poem develops. The line \u201cMeanwhile the world goes on\u201d represents a shift in theme and tone. At this point, the poet reminds the reader that we are all part of something larger: \u201cthe world offers itself to your imagination... announcing your place / in the family of things.\u201d This is meant to comfort the reader, letting each of us know that while we are allowed to dwell on that which is difficult in our lives and our imperfections, we must also remember that the world holds a place for each of us \u201cin the family of things.\u201d\n<br/>\n\n**Example Rubric**<br/>\n![](https://d343hwwwhotitb.cloudfront.net/tasks/kraked-1522461256-itemimage_RL.11-12.2%20TK%20goal%20rubric.png)",

This section uses the example of the three-link food chain found on Isle Royale involving wolves, moose, and trees. The author explains how these represent predators, prey, and producers, and how their populations are impacted by one another. For example, in the summer when lots of vegetation grows, moose are able to eat more and gain more weight, but in winter less vegetation grows, offering less energy to be consumed by the moose. This section is organized as a detailed real-world example of the concepts described in the rest of the passage.",

Highlighting the facts in advance accomplishes two things: it eliminates an extra step, giving students more work time; and it also alleviates the potential problem that the student could underline a \"fact\" that is irrelevant. This scaffold can be adjusted to the student's individual comfort level - for example, perhaps one text is more difficult than the other, so the teacher decides to highlight a fact in that text and leave the other for the student to find herself.",

There is no doubt, however, that the world will always remember Amelia Earhart for her courage, vision, and groundbreaking achievements, both in aviation and for women. In a letter to her husband, written in case a dangerous flight proved to be her last, this brave spirit was evident. \"Please know I am quite aware of the hazards,\" she said. \"I want to do it because I want to do it. Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their failure must be but a challenge to others.\u201d*<br/>\n\nWrite 5-7 sentences explaining how Amelia Earhart\u2019s words about her last flight show that her career in aviation was fueled by more than just personal ambition. Include at least 2 examples from the entire passage to show how she exemplified these ideals in her life. How does this final paragraph strengthen the concept of Amelia Earhart\u2019s legacy in the passage?\n\n**Example Response**<br/>\nAmelia Earhart\u2019s words show that her career in aviation was about something more than herself by putting her own life on the line. The text shares Earhart\u2019s own words: \u201cWomen must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their failure must be but a challenge to others.\u201d She wanted to prove that chances weren\u2019t just meant to be taken by men. Earlier in the passage, it explained how she always looked up to brave women, saying: \u201cShe also kept a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about successful women in predominantly male-oriented fields, including film direction and production, law, advertising, management, and mechanical engineering.\u201d This shows that Earhart always was drawn to trailblazing women, and wanted to become one to inspire others and open new possibilities for young girls. The final paragraph is important because it emphasizes this idea and also shows how brave she was to take on a dangerous mission.\n\n**Rubric (5 points)**<br/>\n+1 point: Explains what is learned from last paragraph<br/>\n+1 point: Example from passages  (+1 per for a total of 2 points)<br/>\n+1 point: Describes how last paragraph strengthens key concept<br/>\n+1 point: Response is coherent, cohesive, and demonstrates comprehension<br/>",

The familiarity that students get with a text through these repeated meetings increase their comfort with the story, as well as the print of the text. Some students may memorize a text simply from repeated readings, allowing them to master left-to-right directionality of the text even before they are independently decoding it.",

Supporting students with a [[ Picture Walk | picture walk ]] to remind them of the story may allow some students to independently succeed with this goal. A picture walk may be done independently or may be accompanied with a retelling of the story by the teacher, depending on the students' immediate needs.

For example, the family appeared to be having fun dancing to the music, but later his son didn\u2019t know if he was yelling at them, or just trying to be heard over the loud music: \u201cEvery word was shouted over the music, so it was hard to tell if he was mad or just making fun.\u201d In the passage, the brothers seem excited that their father is ready to dance, but they wonder if the mood will turn at any moment. The boys also seem to be apprehensive about their father\u2019s drinking habits: \u201cWe took in the empties stacked up on the counter behind him, then we looked at each other.\u201d When the narrator and his brothers notice that their father has been drinking for quite a while, based on the empty cans lined up on the counter, they worried about what would happen next. As he watches his father dance, the narrator observes that his father\u2019s face \u201csnarled and smiled both.\u201d In conclusion, the scene shows the unpredictable and tenuous relationship between the narrator and his father.\n\n**Scoring Rubric**  <br>\n![](https://d343hwwwhotitb.cloudfront.net/tasks/kraked-1521499554-itemimage_RL.9-10.1_TK%20Goal%20Rubric.png)",

State a claim and then cite at least **three** pieces of evidence from the passage. Explain how each piece of evidence supports your inference. <br>\n\n**Example Student Response** <br>\nIn *Never Let Me Go*, Hailsham is a place that brings up complicated emotions and memories for Kathy H. The text states: \u201cAnd I'm a Hailsham student\u2014 which is enough by itself sometimes to get people's backs up. Kathy H., they say, she gets to pick and choose, and she always chooses her own kind: people from Hailsham, or one of the other privileged estates.\u201d It seems that other carers resent her for having been part of this prestigious school, which suggests that other schools are not as nice as Hailsham. Kathy H. may feel grateful for this, but isolated because others judge her for it. <br>\n\nShe goes on to explain: \u201cThere have been times over the years when I've tried to leave Hailsham behind, when I've told myself I shouldn't look back so much. But then there came a point when I just stopped resisting.\u201d Kathy H. feels conflicted about her memories of Hailsham. She wants to let go of these memories, but allows herself to think about them like a guilty pleasure. This implies that a part of her past is complicated or difficult to face. Finally, it seems that Hailsham itself remains an enigma: \u201c...And I'll think: \u2018Maybe that's it! I've found it! This actually is Hailsham!\u2019 Then I see it's impossible and I go on driving, my thoughts drifting on elsewhere.\u201d It seems like Kathy H. does not know the location of Hailsham, and if she ever thinks for a moment that she has stumbled upon it, her first reaction is excitement. She immediately realizes that it is not really the place from her past, and is filled with disappointment as she continues on.\n<br>\n\n**Example Rubric** <br>\n![](https://d343hwwwhotitb.cloudfront.net/tasks/kraked-1521500522-itemimage_RL.11-12.1_TK%20Goal%20Rubric.png)",

The reader assumes the narrator is a fellow high school student, observing Oscar and his awkwardness and sadness when feeling left out. Later, the author develops Oscar\u2019s character further to represent the theme of being true to oneself: \u201cdude wore his nerdiness like a Jedi wore his light saber.\u201d Oscar\u2019s unique nerdiness led to heartbreak, because the girls he liked did not notice him: \u201cIt would have been one thing if like some of the nerdboys I\u2019d grown up with he hadn\u2019t cared about girls, but alas he was still the passionate enamorao who fell in love easily and deeply.\u201d Through memorable character development and language, the author developed the passage\u2019s theme vividly.\n\n**Example Scoring Rubric** <br>\n![](https://d343hwwwhotitb.cloudfront.net/tasks/kraked-1521853602-itemimage_RL.9-10.2%20TK%20goal%20rubric.png)",

She also addresses issues of poverty and religion, but she always brings the focus back to education. For example, after discussing her attack, she says, \u201cI am here to speak for the right of education for every child. I want education for the sons and daughters of the Taliban and all the terrorists and extremists.\u201d In addition, she discusses women\u2019s rights and relates this to how education can solve those problems, as well. Later in the speech, she says: \u201cThis is why they killed 14 innocent students in the recent attack in Quetta. And that is why they kill female teachers. That is why they are blasting schools every day because they were and they are afraid of change and equality that we will bring to our society.\u201d Malala uses her wide variety of experiences to relate every possible situation to education and how it can solve many problems. She has a clear vision about the power of education and she does not waver from that message.\n\n**Example [[https://goalbookapp.com/pathways/#!/resources/de00f8f2-abb7-4d35-525b-2f501ecb71dd | Rubric]]** <br>\n![](https://d343hwwwhotitb.cloudfront.net/tasks/kraked-1521404167-itemimage_RI.11-12.1%20TK%20Goal%20Rubric.png)",

Identify one claim the author makes and explain how it supports this argument. Then, identify one piece of evidence from the text and explain if it is relevant or irrelevant in supporting the author\u2019s argument. \n\n**Example Student Response:**\n\nOne claim that the author makes is that lightning causes hazards. This supports the argument because it explains one reason why it is necessary for NASA to study lightning. One piece of evidence from the text that the author uses is how a spacecraft\u2019s electronics were interrupted by lightning when they were on a mission. This evidence is relevant to the author\u2019s argument because it gives a strong example of the dangers of lightning and why NASA would need to study it.\n\n**Example Rubric** (out of 4 points)\n\n+1 point: Correctly identifies a claim from the text\n<br>+1 point: Provides an accurate analysis of how it supports the central argument\n<br>+1 point: Correctly identifies a piece of evidence from the text\n<br>+1 point: Provides an accurate evaluation of whether or not the evidence was relevant and why.",

Thompson proposed that the positive and negative charges in an atom are spread evenly throughout the atom. Rutherford shot positive particles at gold foil, and expected them all to go straight through the spread-out positive charges suggested by Thompson's model. Because the positive charge was so spread out, it wouldn't repel the positive particles being shot at it. But Rutherford found that most of the positive particles went through as predicted, but some particles bounced back. They were repelled. This conflicted with Thompson's model suggesting that, instead of being spread evenly throughout the atom, the positive charge in an atom is concentrated in one area.",
