Explanation of Apology of Action:
This type of apology involves two parts; issuing a verbal apology, then attempting to make amends through an action (e.g. ""I'm sorry I made you feel left out. Would it make you feel better if we sat together at lunch?"") This strategy relies on both the verbal apology and problem solving to attempt to fix the situation.",Apologize to Make Amends,['Relationship Skills'],"[{'_id': '554e76d0645c28a8490000b2', 'created_at': '2014-03-18 16:28:37Z', 'text': 'Students may be familiar with the idea ""you break it, you fix it"".
