Prior to beginning any physical activity, the teacher should check to see if students are medically cleared to do strenuous activities (this information can be found in an IEP, by checking with the school nurse, or asking a parent/guardian). A student using a walker or gait trainer, for example, can move at a comfortable pace, and complete a specified distance without a time constraint. On the other hand, if a student is physically cleared to run but chooses not to, the teacher should seek behavior modifications instead of modifying the physical fitness routine (e.g. if the student successfully completes the task, he or she is rewarded with 5 minutes of a preferred PE activity, such as basketball).', 'udl_standard_checkpoint_ref': 'UDL II 5.3', 'udl_standard_long_ref': 'UDL II 5.3 Provide Multiple Means of Action and Expression: Build fluencies with graduated levels of support for practice and performance', 'udl_standard_short_ref': 'UDL II 5.3 Build fluencies with graduated levels of support for practice and performance', 'updated_at': '2018-01-16 21:56:02Z', 'updated_time': 1516139762351, 'uuid': 'a2f85938-8c97-48cc-a7ee-242dc6aeec12'}]",2018-01-16 21:56:02Z,1516139762369,72c5c282-360d-4544-aec0-fe67aa456d58,[]
