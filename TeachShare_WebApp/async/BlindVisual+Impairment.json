To start, point out one particularly difficult visual situation and one or two relatively easy visual situations on the task schedule. For example, show students the daily task pictures for environments like gym class, silent reading time, and independent work time. Ask the student: \u201cDuring which activity do you have the most trouble seeing?\u201d In this example, the student may point to the gym class picture, because gym demands both near- and far-sighted vision for many activities, as well as a great deal of movement. After students identify a choice, move forward with a discussion about *why* it is hard to see in that setting. Providing opportunity to dissect the day like this can also shed great light on where a student\u2019s greatest challenges actually are, which then provides the chance to find and implement useful accommodations.",

To help the student narrow it down, ask questions that already acknowledge the overall setting, such as \"When it's hard to see in math, what are you usually doing?\" If the student still responds with a very general answer (e.g. \"I'm sitting at my desk.\"), ask a follow up guiding question such as, \"Who or what are you trying to see when it\u2019s hard to see?\" Ask questions which don\u2019t allow a yes or no answer, so that a student is forced to explain more about what she can see and do and allow for growth in self-advocating for the accommodations that best help.",

Model how to think aloud about what one wants to wear, and how this can help us keep an idea (e.g. \u201cLooking for a red shirt now!\u201d) in the front of our brain, so that we don\u2019t get sidetracked or forget what we were looking for. For braille readers, create a written diagram of a closet or drawer space that can serve as a bird\u2019s eye guide for the dressing area.",

If a student demonstrates independence with measuring detergent consistently, isolate the manipulation of the machine and loading of the clothes. In this way, all of the laundry steps can be assessed but in a piecemeal fashion. Also, amend the task if a washing machine or dryer is unavailable. For example, a student can identify how much detergent is needed for a load of laundry or state the steps to using laundry machines (e.g. how one knows when the wash cycle is complete, what buttons to press, what does one do when the washing machine is finished).",

For a blind student, reinforcing these steps with verbal reminders and recitation is useful. Alternately, if they read braille, a task schedule in braille can be utilized.

Allow them to complete the numerous steps that are embedded in folding or hanging up clothes at an appropriate pace, order, or style. Perhaps a student can fold everything except large items like sheets and blankets, while another student who manages well with towels, pants, and socks, has trouble with the sleeves on shirts, particularly button-downs. Modify the expectations for those students, and perhaps try again another time. If folding and hanging are not possible (e.g. physical limitations), teach the student to place clean clothes in a designated clean-clothes bin or area of a counter and to notify someone that the clothes are ready to be folded.",

Be sure to talk through the steps with the students as they may have questions about specific details about which they need more explanation or support. For example, turn-taking and non-verbal cues that exist within a game may need to be anticipated, or the student may need to ask for verbal cues to be given to them (e.g. \u201cSay my name when it\u2019s my turn to run, since I can\u2019t see the other runner coming across the gym.\u201d). Also, be consistent in the language used to describe objects, movements, or physical or spatial positioning to help reduce confusion.

This is behavior that must be modeled and practiced over a long period of time. There exist many factors that can impede a student\u2019s ability (or desire) to decline help (e.g. flux in confidence, forgetting how to do a task that has been done before, impact of mood), and it\u2019s ok to accept help for something that yesterday seemed simple. Conversely, it\u2019s ok to decline help for something that yesterday required some assistance. This is, of course, true for all students, but a visual impairment can exacerbate the frustrations of wanting and not wanting help. Model for the students how all of these thoughts and emotions effect how we react to others and how we can think aloud to ourselves and our peers. Have students repeat to practice: \u201cI know that yesterday you helped me to get a pencil from the writing center, but today I don\u2019t need your help. Thank you.\u201d Also be sure how to accept that someone else is declining your offer for help--this is also a taught skill that requires practice and finesse--\u201dNo problem, I\u2019m glad to help if you need me again sometime.\u201d These social-task lessons can be brief, frequent, and referred to to prompt students when needed.",

For our youngest students, this is behavior that must be modeled and practiced over a long period of time. There exist many factors that can impede a student\u2019s ability (or desire) to decline help (e.g. flux in confidence, forgetting how to do a task that has been done before, impact of mood), and it\u2019s ok to accept help for something that yesterday seemed simple. Conversely, it\u2019s ok to decline help for something that yesterday required some assistance. This is, of course, true for all students, but a visual impairment can exacerbate the frustrations of wanting and not wanting help. Model for the students how all of these thoughts and emotions effect how we react to others and how we can think aloud to ourselves and our peers. Have students repeat to practice: \u201cI know that yesterday you helped me to get a pencil from the writing center, but today I don\u2019t need your help. Thank you.\u201d Also be sure how to accept that someone else is declining your offer for help--this is also a taught skill that requires practice and finesse--\u201dNo problem, I\u2019m glad to help if you need me again sometime.\u201d These social-task lessons can be brief, frequent, and referred to to prompt students when needed.",

For those students who can, explicitly teach how to point to or offer the card while also verbally stating the refusal of help: \u201cThanks, but I want to do this myself.\u201d Students might love to have a response card that includes a photograph of themselves doing a task that peers commonly offer help for. For example, students often want to open and hold doors for those with a visual impairment. Take a photograph of the target student opening or holding a door for himself, and include this on a card that says \u201cNo thanks!\u201d",

Certain tasks, like hair that\u2019s out of place, can be nearly impossible for a blind student to self-assess, at least not as quickly as a sighted student can with a glance into a mirror. A quick and quiet prompt can remind the student in an unobtrusive manner (e.g. Discreetly whisper, \"A hair is sticking up on top of your head.\"). If a student has a highly-trusted peer, this friend can also be prompted to remind the student in order to lessen the chance that embarrassment will become a factor. A verbal prompt can also be paired with physically handing the student the tool that is used for the task, although, again, privacy can complicate this approach. For example, if a student needs a sanitary pad, a trusted friend can provide this pad to her without any other peers noticing.",

On the other hand, peer relationships can also be tricky here (e.g. lead to feelings of humiliation or embarrassment), and so depending on the student, advice about body odor or unkempt hair might be received better from a teacher. Either way, the discussion should include conversation about hygiene and issues of peer pressure and social complications explicitly from the beginning.

Students may need help making contact with a club (e.g. by phone, email, in person) or exploring a website to get more information about where an activity can take place (e.g. location of a community swimming pool). If a student is anxious and expecting a negative reception, a peer or teacher can help by being present as moral support, to make introductions, and just to be a friend while new acquaintances are made and new experiences are explored. As time progresses and confidence builds, the student can be released to greater independence, not only in the first social activity, but potentially in exploring future new activities, as well.",

Conversely, it\u2019s ok to decline help for something that yesterday required some assistance. This is, of course, true for all students, but a visual impairment can exacerbate the frustrations of wanting and not wanting help. Have students repeat to practice: \u201cI know that yesterday you helped me to get a pencil from the writing center, but today I don\u2019t need your help. Thank you.\u201d Alternately, be sure students also know how to accept a declination of an offer for help--this is also a taught skill that requires practice and finesse--\"No problem, I\u2019m glad to help if you need me again sometime.\u201d These social task lessons can be brief, frequent, and referred to to prompt students when needed.",

Certainly a nonverbal student would benefit from pointing to or handing a card that says \u201cNo thanks\u201d to a student who has offered help, but so too might a shy or hesitant student, one who has receptive or active verbal-processing needs, or one who is simply new to the task of declining help. For those students who can, explicitly teach how to point to or offer the card while also verbally stating the refusal of help: \u201cThanks, but I want to do this myself.\u201d Students might love to have a response card that includes a photograph of themselves doing a task that peers commonly offer help for. For example, younger students often want to open and hold doors for those with a visual impairment. Take a photograph of the target student opening or holding a door for himself, and include this on a card that says \u201cNo thanks!\u201d Normalize the cards by providing them to everyone when explicitly teaching, modeling, and practicing polite conversation within the classroom.",

For example, if a student expresses interest in a crafting club, but worries that his blindness will make him stand out and receive unwanted attention, another student in that club can share the fact that there are a few students with various disabilities in the club already. They can decide to go visit the club together and see how it feels.",
