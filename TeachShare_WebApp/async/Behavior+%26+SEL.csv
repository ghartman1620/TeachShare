Example of Cooperative Learning Strategies
1. Group members are required to share, jobs, materials, knowledge, time, talents, and effort (or any combination of these). 
2. Group members must use positive interpersonal communication skills such as active listening, building consensus, sharing, giving support and encouragement, restating, and using appropriate eye contact and gestures.
